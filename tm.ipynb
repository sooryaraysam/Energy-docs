official journal of the european union regulation of the european parliament and of the council of may on the labelling of tyres with respect to fuel efficiency and other parameters amending regulation and repealing regulation no the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article and article thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee after consulting the committee of the regions acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure whereas the union is committed to building an energy union with forward looking climate policy fuel efficiency is crucial element of the union climate and energy policy framework and is key to moderating energy demand the commission has reviewed regulation no of the european parliament and of the council and has identified the need to update its provisions to improve its effectiveness it is appropriate to replace regulation no in order to clarify and update some of its provisions taking into account technological progress with regard to tyres the transport sector accounts for third of the union energy consumption road transport was responsible for about of the union total greenhouse gas emissions in tyres mainly because of their rolling resistance account for to of the fuel consumption of vehicles reduction in the rolling resistance of tyres would therefore contribute significantly to the fuel efficiency of road transport and thus to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and to the decarbonisation of the transport sector in order to meet the challenge of reducing the co emissions of road transport it is appropriate that member states in cooperation with the commission provide for incentives to innovate with regard to fuel efficient and safe tyres tyres and tyres tyres are characterised by number of interrelated parameters improving one parameter such as rolling resistance may have an adverse impact on other parameters such as wet grip while improving wet grip performance may have an adverse impact on external rolling noise tyre manufacturers should be encouraged to optimise all parameters beyond the current standards fuel efficient tyres can be cost effective since the fuel savings that they generate more than offset the increased purchase price resulting from the higher production costs of such tyres regulation no of the european parliament and of the council lays down minimum requirements for the rolling resistance of tyres technological developments make it possible to reduce the energy losses that are due to tyre rolling resistance significantly beyond those minimum requirements to reduce the environmental impact of road transport it is therefore appropriate to update the provisions on the labelling of tyres to encourage end users to purchase more fuel efficient tyres by providing them with harmonised information on the rolling resistance parameter improving the labelling of tyres will enable consumers to obtain more relevant and more comparable information on fuel efficiency safety and noise and to take cost effective and environmentally friendly decisions when purchasing tyres traffic noise is significant nuisance and has harmful effect on health regulation no lays down minimum requirements for the external rolling noise of tyres technological developments make it possible to reduce external rolling noise significantly beyond those minimum requirements to reduce traffic noise it is therefore appropriate to update the provisions on the labelling of tyres to encourage end users to purchase tyres with lower external rolling noise by providing them with harmonised information on the external rolling noise parameter the provision of harmonised information on external rolling noise also facilitates the implementation of measures to limit traffic noise and contributes to increased awareness of the effect of tyres on traffic noise within the framework of directive ec of the european parliament and of the council regulation no also lays down minimum requirements for the wet grip of tyres technological developments make it possible to improve wet grip significantly beyond those minimum requirements and thus to reduce wet braking distances to improve road safety it is therefore appropriate to update the provisions on the labelling of tyres to encourage end users to purchase tyres with higher wet grip performance by providing them with harmonised information on the wet grip parameter in order to ensure alignment with the international framework regulation no refers to regulation no of the economic commission for europe of the united nations which sets out the relevant measurement methods for the rolling resistance external rolling noise and wet and snow grip performance of tyres information on the performance of tyres that are specifically designed for use in severe snow and ice conditions should be included on the tyre label information on snow grip performance should be based on regulation no of the economic commission for europe of the united nations in its most up to date version applicable to the union and the alpine symbol pictogram contained therein should be included on the tyre label of tyre which satisfies the minimum snow grip index values set out in that regulation information on ice grip performance should once the standard is formally adopted be based on iso standard iso and the ice grip pictogram should be included on the tyre label of tyre which satisfies the minimum ice grip index values set out in that iso standard until adoption of iso standard iso ice grip performance should be assessed against reliable accurate and reproducible methods which take into account the generally recognised state of the art the tyre label of tyre which satisfies the minimum ice grip performance standards should show the ice grip pictogram set out in annex the abrasion of tyres during use is significant source of microplastics which are harmful to the environment and human health the commission communication european strategy for plastics in circular economy therefore mentions the need to address the unintentional release of microplastics from tyres inter alia through information measures such as labelling and through minimum requirements for tyres linked to tyre abrasion is the concept of mileage namely the number of kilometres tyre will last before it needs to be replaced because of tread wear in addition to tyre abrasion and tread wear the lifespan of tyre depends on range of factors such as the wear resistance of the tyre including the compound tread pattern and structure road conditions maintenance tyre pressure and driving behaviour however suitable testing method to measure tyre abrasion and mileage is not currently available therefore the commission should mandate the development of such testing method taking into full consideration the state of the art and internationally developed or proposed standards and regulations as well as the work carried out by industry re treaded tyres constitute substantial part of the market for heavy duty vehicle tyres the re treading of tyres extends their lifespan and contributes to circular economy objectives such as waste reduction applying labelling requirements to such tyres would bring substantial energy savings this regulation should provide for the future inclusion of suitable testing method to measure the performance of re treaded tyres which is not currently available the energy label provided for under regulation of the european parliament and of the council which ranks the energy consumption of products on scale from to is recognised by over of union consumers as clear and transparent information tool and has proven to be effective in promoting more efficient products the tyre label should be of the same design to the extent possible while recognising the specificities of tyre parameters the provision of comparable information on tyre parameters in the form of standard tyre label is likely to influence purchasing decisions by end users in favour of more fuel efficient longer lasting safer and quieter tyres this in turn is likely to encourage tyre manufacturers to optimise tyre parameters which would pave the way for more sustainable consumption and production of tyres the need for greater information on fuel efficiency and other parameters is relevant for all end users including purchasers of replacement tyres purchasers of tyres fitted on new vehicles and fleet managers and transport undertakings who cannot easily compare the parameters of different tyre brands in the absence of labelling and harmonised testing regime it is therefore appropriate to require that tyre label be provided for all tyres offered with or fitted on vehicles currently tyre labels are required for tyres for cars and vans but not for heavy duty vehicles tyres consume more fuel and cover more kilometres per year than tyres or tyres and therefore the potential to reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from heavy duty vehicles is significant therefore tyres should be included in the scope of this regulation including tyres fully in the scope of this regulation is also in line with regulation of the european parliament and of the council which provides for the monitoring and reporting of co emissions from and fuel consumption of new heavy duty vehicles and with regulation of the european parliament and of the council which sets co emission performance standards for new heavy duty vehicles many end users make tyre purchasing decisions without seeing the actual tyre and therefore do not see the tyre label affixed to it in such situations end users should be shown the tyre label before taking their purchasing decisions the display of tyre label on tyres at the point of sale as well as in technical promotional material should ensure that distributors as well as potential end users receive harmonised information on the relevant tyre parameters at the time and place of the purchasing decision some end users make tyre purchasing decisions before arriving at the point of sale or purchase tyres by mail order or on the internet to ensure that those end users can also make an informed choice on the basis of harmonised information on inter alia fuel efficiency wet grip and external rolling noise tyre labels should be displayed in all technical promotional material and visual advertisements for specific tyre types including where such material is made available on the internet where visual advertisements pertain to tyre family and not only to specific tyre type the tyre label does not have to be shown potential end users should be provided with information explaining each component of the tyre label and its relevance that information should be provided in all technical promotional material for example on suppliers websites but should not be required in visual advertisements technical promotional material should not be understood to include advertisements via billboards newspapers magazines or radio or television broadcasts without prejudice to the market surveillance obligations of member states or to the obligation of suppliers to check product conformity suppliers should make the requisite product compliance information electronically available in the product database the information that is relevant to consumers and distributors should be made publicly available in the public part of the product database that information should be made available as open data so as to give mobile application developers and comparison tools the opportunity to use it easy direct access to the public part of the product database should be facilitated by user oriented tools that are included on the printed tyre label such as dynamic quick response code the compliance part of the product database should be subject to strict data protection rules the required specific parts of the technical documentation in the compliance part of the product database should be made available both to market surveillance authorities and to the commission where technical information is too sensitive to include it in the category of technical documentation market surveillance authorities should have access to that information when necessary in accordance with the duty of cooperation on suppliers or by way of additional parts of the technical documentation uploaded to the product database by suppliers on voluntary basis the sale of tyres through internet sales platforms rather than directly from suppliers is growing therefore hosting service providers should enable the display of the tyre label and product information sheet provided by the supplier close to the price indication they should inform the distributor of the obligation to display the tyre label and product information sheet but should not be responsible for the accuracy or content of that tyre label or product information sheet the obligations imposed on hosting service providers under this regulation should remain limited to what is reasonable and should not amount to general obligation to monitor the information that they store or to actively seek facts or circumstances indicating activities that do not comply with the requirements of this regulation however article of directive ec of the european parliament and of the council requires hosting service providers that wish to benefit from the liability exemption contained in that provision to act expeditiously to remove or disable access to information that they store at the request of recipients of their services where such information does not comply with the requirements of this regulation such as those relating to missing incomplete or incorrect tyre labels or product information sheets they should do so as soon as they obtain actual knowledge of such information or as regards claims for damages as soon as they become aware of such information for example through specific information provided by market surveillance authority suppliers selling directly to end users via their own website are subject to the same distance selling obligations as distributors rolling resistance wet grip external rolling noise and other parameters should be measured in accordance with reliable accurate and reproducible methods that take into account the generally recognised state of the art measurement and calculation methods as far as possible such methods should reflect average consumer behaviour and be robust in order to deter both intentional and unintentional circumvention tyre labels should reflect the comparative performance of the tyres in actual use within the constraints arising from the need for reliable accurate and reproducible laboratory testing in order to enable end users to compare different tyres and to limit testing costs for manufacturers where they have sufficient reason to believe that supplier has not ensured the accuracy of the tyre label and in order to give additional confidence to consumers national authorities as defined in point of article of regulation of the european parliament and of the council should check whether the classes for rolling resistance wet grip and external rolling noise displayed on the tyre label as well as the pictograms for other parameters correspond to the documentation provided by the supplier based on test results and calculations such checks may take place during the type approval process and do not necessarily require the physical testing of the tyre compliance by suppliers wholesalers dealers and other distributors with the provisions on the labelling of tyres is essential in order to ensure level playing field in the union member states should therefore monitor such compliance through regular ex post controls and market surveillance in accordance with regulation of the european parliament and of the council in order to facilitate the monitoring of compliance to provide useful tool to end users and to allow alternative ways for distributors to receive product information sheets tyres should be included in the product database established under regulation that regulation should therefore be amended accordingly in order for end users to have confidence in the tyre label other labels that mimic the tyre label should not be allowed for the same reason other labels marks symbols or inscriptions that are likely to mislead or confuse end users with respect to the parameters covered by the tyre label should not be allowed the penalties applicable to infringements of this regulation and of the delegated acts adopted pursuant thereto should be effective proportionate and dissuasive in order to promote energy efficiency climate change mitigation road safety and environmental protection member states should be able to create incentives for the use of energy efficient and safe tyres member states are free to decide on the nature of such incentives such incentives should comply with union state aid rules and should not constitute unjustifiable market barriers this regulation does not prejudice the outcome of any state aid procedures that may be undertaken in accordance with articles and of the treaty on the functioning of the european union in respect of such incentives in order to amend the content and format of the tyre label to introduce requirements with respect to re treaded tyres tyre abrasion and mileage and to adapt the annexes to technological progress the power to adopt acts in accordance with article tfeu should be delegated to the commission it is of particular importance that the commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work including at expert level and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the interinstitutional agreement of april on better law making in particular to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts the european parliament and the council receive all documents at the same time as member states experts and their experts systematically have access to meetings of commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts once reliable accurate and reproducible methods to test and measure tyre abrasion and mileage are available the commission should assess the feasibility of adding information on tyre abrasion and mileage to the tyre label when proposing delegated act to add tyre abrasion and mileage to the tyre label the commission should take that assessment into account and should collaborate closely with industry relevant standardisation organisations such as the european committee for standardization the united nations economic commission for europe or the international organisation for standardisation and representatives of other stakeholders interested in the development of suitable testing methods information on tyre abrasion and mileage should be unambiguous and should not negatively affect the clear intelligibility and effectiveness of the tyre label as whole towards end users such information would also enable end users to make an informed choice with regard to tyres their lifespan and the unintentional release of microplastics this would help protect the environment and at the same time allow end users to estimate the operating costs of tyres over longer period tyres which were already placed on the market before the date of application of this regulation should not need to be provided with new tyre label the size of the tyre label should remain the same as that set out in regulation no details regarding snow grip and ice grip and the qr code should be included on the tyre label the commission should carry out an evaluation of this regulation in accordance with paragraph of the interinstitutional agreement of april on better law making that evaluation should be based on efficiency effectiveness relevance coherence and value added and should provide the basis for impact assessments of options for further action since the objective of this regulation namely to increase safety the protection of health and the economic and environmental efficiency of road transport by providing information to end users to allow them to choose more fuel efficient longer lasting safer and quieter tyres cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states because it requires harmonised information for end users but can rather by reason of the need for harmonised regulatory framework and level playing field for manufacturers be better achieved at union level the union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article of the treaty on european union regulation remains the appropriate legal instrument as it imposes clear and detailed rules which preclude divergent transposition by member states and thus ensures higher degree of harmonisation across the union harmonised regulatory framework at union rather than at member state level reduces costs for suppliers ensures level playing field and ensures the free movement of goods across the internal market in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in article teu this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective regulation no should therefore be repealed with effect from the date of the application of this regulation have adopted this regulation article subject matter this regulation establishes framework for the provision of harmonised information on tyre parameters through labelling to allow end users to make an informed choice when purchasing tyres for the purpose of increasing safety the protection of health and the economic and environmental efficiency of road transport by promoting fuel efficient long lasting and safe tyres with low noise levels

journal of the european union directive of the european parliament and of the council of june on common rules for the internal market for electricity and amending directive eu the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee having regard to the opinion of the committee of the regions acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure whereas number of amendments are to be made to directive ec of the european parliament and of the council in the interests of clarity that directive should be recast the internal market for electricity which has been progressively implemented throughout the union since aims by organising competitive electricity markets across country borders to deliver real choice for all union final customers be they citizens or businesses new business opportunities competitive prices efficient investment signals and higher standards of service and to contribute to security of supply and sustainability directive ec of the european parliament and of the council and directive ec have made significant contribution towards the creation of the internal market for electricity however the union energy system is in the middle of profound change the common goal of decarbonising the energy system creates new opportunities and challenges for market participants at the same time technological developments allow for new forms of consumer participation and cross border cooperation there is need to adapt the union market rules to new market reality the commission communication of february entitled framework strategy for resilient energy union with forward looking climate change policy sets out vision of an energy union with citizens at its core where citizens take ownership of the energy transition benefit from new technologies to reduce their bills and participate actively in the market and where vulnerable consumers are protected the commission communication of july entitled delivering new deal for energy consumers put forward the commission vision for retail market that better serves energy consumers including by better linking wholesale and retail markets by taking advantage of new technology new and innovative energy service companies should enable all consumers to fully participate in the energy transition managing their consumption to deliver energy efficient solutions which save them money and contribute to the overall reduction of energy consumption the commission communication of july entitled launching the public consultation process on new energy market design highlighted that the move away from generation in large central generating installations towards decentralised production of electricity from renewable sources and towards decarbonised markets requires adapting the current rules of electricity trading and changing the existing market roles the communication underlined the need to organise electricity markets in more flexible manner and to fully integrate all market players including producers of renewable energy new energy service providers energy storage and flexible demand it is equally important for the union to invest urgently in interconnection at union level for the transfer of energy through high voltage electricity transmission systems with view to creating an internal market for electricity member states should foster the integration of their national markets and cooperation among system operators at union and regional level and incorporate isolated systems that form electricity islands that persist in the union in addition to addressing new challenges this directive seeks to address the persisting obstacles to the completion of the internal market for electricity the refined regulatory framework needs to contribute to overcoming the current problems of fragmented national markets which are still often determined by high degree of regulatory interventions such interventions have led to obstacles to the supply of electricity on equal terms as well as higher costs in comparison to solutions based on cross border cooperation and market based principles the union would most effectively meet its renewable energy targets through the creation of market framework that rewards flexibility and innovation well functioning electricity market design is the key factor enabling the uptake of renewable energy consumers have an essential role to play in achieving the flexibility necessary to adapt the electricity system to variable and distributed renewable electricity generation technological progress in grid management and the generation of renewable electricity has unlocked many opportunities for consumers healthy competition in retail markets is essential to ensuring the market driven deployment of innovative new services that address consumers changing needs and abilities while increasing system flexibility however the lack of real time or near real time information provided to consumers about their energy consumption has prevented them from being active participants in the energy market and the energy transition by empowering consumers and providing them with the tools to participate more in the energy market including participating in new ways it is intended that citizens in the union benefit from the internal market for electricity and that the union renewable energy targets are attained the freedoms which the treaty on the functioning of the european union guarantees the citizens of the union inter alia the free movement of goods the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services are achievable only in fully open market which enables all consumers freely to choose their suppliers and all suppliers freely to deliver to their customers promoting fair competition and easy access for different suppliers is of the utmost importance for member states in order to allow consumers to take full advantage of the opportunities of liberalised internal market for electricity nonetheless it is possible that market failure persists in peripheral small electricity systems and in systems not connected with other member states where electricity prices fail to provide the right signal to drive investment and therefore requires specific solutions to ensure an adequate level of security of supply in order to foster competition and ensure the supply of electricity at the most competitive price member states and regulatory authorities should facilitate cross border access for new suppliers of electricity from different energy sources as well as for new providers of generation energy storage and demand response member states should ensure that no undue barriers exist within the internal market for electricity as regards market entry operation and exit at the same time it should be clarified that that obligation is without prejudice to the competence that member states retain in relation to third countries that clarification should not be interpreted as enabling member state to exercise the exclusive competence of the union it should also be clarified that market participants from third countries who operate within the internal market are to comply with the applicable union and national law in the same manner as other market participants market rules allow for the entry and exit of producers and suppliers based on their assessment of the economic and financial viability of their operations that principle is not incompatible with the possibility for member states to impose on undertakings operating in the electricity sector public service obligations in the general economic interest in accordance with the treaties in particular with article tfeu and with this directive and regulation of the european parliament and of the council the european council of and october stated in its conclusions that the commission supported by the member states is to take urgent measures in order to ensure the achievement of minimum target of of existing electricity interconnections as matter of urgency and no later than at least for member states which have not yet attained minimum level of integration in the internal energy market which are the baltic states portugal and spain and for member states which constitute their main point of access to the internal energy market it further stated that the commission is also to report regularly to the european council with the objective of arriving at target by sufficient physical interconnection with neighbouring countries is important to enable member states and neighbouring countries to benefit from the positive effects of the internal market as stressed in the commission communication of november entitled communication on strengthening europe energy networks and as reflected in member states integrated national energy and climate plans under regulation of the european parliament and of the council electricity markets differ from other markets such as those for natural gas for example because they involve the trading in commodity which cannot currently be easily stored and which is produced using large variety of generating installations including through distributed generation this has been reflected in the different approaches to the regulatory treatment of interconnectors in the electricity and gas sectors the integration of electricity markets requires high degree of cooperation among system operators market participants and regulatory authorities in particular where electricity is traded via market coupling securing common rules for true internal market and broad supply of electricity that is accessible to all should also be one of the main goals of this directive to that end undistorted market prices would provide incentives for cross border interconnections and for investments in new electricity generation while leading to price convergence in the long term market prices should give the right incentives for the development of the network and for investing in new electricity generation different types of market organisation exist in the internal market for electricity the measures that member states could take in order to ensure level playing field should be based on overriding requirements of general interest the commission should be consulted on the compatibility of those measures with the tfeu and with other union law member states should maintain wide discretion to impose public service obligations on electricity undertakings in pursuing objectives of general economic interest member states should ensure that household customers and where member states consider it to be appropriate small enterprises enjoy the right to be supplied with electricity of specified quality at clearly comparable transparent and competitive prices nevertheless public service obligations in the form of price setting for the supply of electricity constitute fundamentally distortive measure that often leads to the accumulation of tariff deficits the limitation of consumer choice poorer incentives for energy saving and energy efficiency investments lower standards of service lower levels of consumer engagement and satisfaction and the restriction of competition as well as to there being fewer innovative products and services on the market consequently member states should apply other policy tools in particular targeted social policy measures to safeguard the affordability of electricity supply to their citizens public interventions in price setting for the supply of electricity should be carried out only as public service obligations and should be subject to specific conditions set out in this directive fully liberalised well functioning retail electricity market would stimulate price and non price competition among existing suppliers and provide incentives to new market entrants thereby improving consumer choice and satisfaction public service obligations in the form of price setting for the supply of electricity should be used without overriding the principle of open markets in clearly defined circumstances and beneficiaries and should be limited in duration such circumstances might occur for example where supply is severely constrained causing significantly higher electricity prices than normal or in the event of market failure where interventions by regulatory authorities and competition authorities have proven to be ineffective this would disproportionately affect households and in particular vulnerable customers who typically expend higher share of their disposable income on energy bills compared to high income consumers in order to mitigate the distortive effects of public service obligations in price setting for the supply of electricity member states applying such interventions should put in place additional measures including measures to prevent distortions of price setting in the wholesale market member states should ensure that all beneficiaries of regulated prices are able to benefit fully from the offers available on the competitive market when they choose to do so to that end those beneficiaries need to be equipped with smart metering systems and have access to dynamic electricity price contracts in addition they should be directly and regularly informed of the offers and savings available on the competitive market in particular relating to dynamic electricity price contracts and should be provided with assistance to respond to and benefit from market based offers the entitlement of beneficiaries of regulated prices to receive individual smart meters without extra costs should not prevent member states from modifying the functionality of smart metering systems where smart meter infrastructure does not exist because the cost benefit assessment regarding the deployment of smart metering systems was negative public interventions in price setting for the supply of electricity should not lead to direct cross subsidisation between different categories of customer according to that principle price systems must not explicitly make certain categories of customer bear the cost of price interventions that affect other categories of customer for example price system in which the cost is borne by suppliers or other operators in non discriminatory manner should not be considered to be direct cross subsidisation in order to ensure the maintenance of the high standards of public service in the union all measures taken by member states to achieve the objective of this directive should be regularly notified to the commission the commission should regularly publish report analysing measures taken at national level to achieve public service objectives and comparing their effectiveness with view to making recommendations as regards measures to be taken at national level to achieve high standards of public service it should be possible for member states to appoint supplier of last resort that supplier might be the sales division of vertically integrated undertaking which also performs distribution functions provided that it meets the unbundling requirements of this directive it should be possible for measures implemented by member states for the purpose of achieving the objectives of social and economic cohesion to include in particular the provision of adequate economic incentives using where appropriate any existing national and union tools such tools may include liability mechanisms to guarantee the necessary investment to the extent that measures taken by member states to fulfil public service obligations constitute state aid under article tfeu there is an obligation under article tfeu to notify them to the commission cross sectorial law provides strong basis for consumer protection for wide range of energy services that exist and is likely to evolve nevertheless certain basic contractual rights of customers should be clearly established plain and unambiguous information should be made available to consumers concerning their rights in relation to the energy sector the commission has established after consulting relevant stakeholders including member states regulatory authorities consumer organisations and electricity undertakings an energy consumer checklist that provides consumers with practical information about their rights that checklist should be kept up to date provided to all consumers and made publicly available several factors impede consumers from accessing understanding and acting upon the various sources of market information available to them it follows that the comparability of offers should be improved and barriers to switching should be minimised to the greatest practicable extent without unduly limiting consumer choice smaller customers are still being charged broad range of fees directly or indirectly as result of switching supplier such fees make it more difficult to identify the best product or service and diminish the immediate financial advantage of switching although removing such fees might limit consumer choice by eliminating products based on rewarding consumer loyalty restricting their use further should improve consumer welfare consumer engagement and competition in the market shorter switching times are likely to encourage consumers to search for better energy deals and switch supplier with the increased deployment of information technology by the year the technical switching process of registering new supplier in metering point at the market operator should typically be possible to complete within hours on any working day notwithstanding other steps in the switching process that are to be completed before the technical process of switching is initiated ensuring that it is possible by that date for the technical process of switching to take place within hours would minimise switching times helping to increase consumer engagement and retail competition in any event the total duration of the switching process should not exceed three weeks from the date of the customer request independent comparison tools including websites are an effective means for smaller customers to assess the merits of the different energy offers that are available on the market such tools lower search costs as customers no longer need to collect information from individual suppliers and service providers such tools can provide the right balance between the need for information to be clear and concise and the need for it to be complete and comprehensive they should aim to include the broadest possible range of available offers and to cover the market as completely as is feasible so as to give the customer representative overview it is crucial that smaller customers have access to at least one comparison tool and that the information given on such tools be trustworthy impartial and transparent to that end member states could provide for comparison tool that is operated by national authority or private company greater consumer protection is guaranteed by the availability of effective independent out of court dispute settlement mechanisms for all consumers such as an energy ombudsman consumer body or regulatory authority member states should introduce speedy and effective complaint handling procedures all consumers should be able to benefit from directly participating in the market in particular by adjusting their consumption according to market signals and in return benefiting from lower electricity prices or other incentive payments the benefits of such active participation are likely to increase over time as the awareness of otherwise passive consumers is raised about their possibilities as active customers and as the information on the possibilities of active participation becomes more accessible and better known consumers should have the possibility of participating in all forms of demand response they should therefore have the possibility of benefiting from the full deployment of smart metering systems and where such deployment has been negatively assessed of choosing to have smart metering system and dynamic electricity price contract this should allow them to adjust their consumption according to real time price signals that reflect the value and cost of electricity or transportation in different time periods while member states should ensure the reasonable exposure of consumers to wholesale price risk consumers should be informed about benefits and potential price risks of dynamic electricity price contracts member states should also ensure that those consumers who choose not to actively engage in the market are not penalised instead their ability to make informed decisions on the options available to them should be facilitated in the manner that is the most suited to domestic market conditions in order to maximise the benefits and effectiveness of dynamic electricity pricing member states should assess the potential for making more dynamic or reducing the share of fixed components in electricity bills and where such potential exists should take appropriate action all customer groups should have access to the electricity markets to trade their flexibility and self generated electricity customers should be allowed to make full use of the advantages of aggregation of production and supply over larger regions and benefit from cross border competition market participants engaged in aggregation are likely to play an important role as intermediaries between customer groups and the market member states should be free to choose the appropriate implementation model and approach to governance for independent aggregation while respecting the general principles set out in this directive such model or approach could include choosing market based or regulatory principles which provide solutions to comply with this directive such as models where imbalances are settled or where perimeter corrections are introduced the chosen model should contain transparent and fair rules to allow independent aggregators to fulfil their roles as intermediaries and to ensure that the final customer adequately benefits from their activities products should be defined on all electricity markets including ancillary services and capacity markets so as to encourage the participation of demand response the commission communication of july entitled european strategy for low emission mobility stresses the need for the decarbonisation of the transport sector and the reduction of its emissions especially in urban areas and highlights the important role that electromobility can play in contributing to those objectives moreover the deployment of electromobility constitutes an important element of the energy transition market rules set out in this directive should therefore contribute to creating favourable conditions for electric vehicles of all kinds in particular they should ensure the effective deployment of publicly accessible and private recharging points for electric vehicles and should ensure the efficient integration of vehicle charging into the system demand response is pivotal to enabling the smart charging of electric vehicles and thereby enabling the efficient integration of electric vehicles into the electricity grid which will be crucial for the process of decarbonising transport consumers should be able to consume to store and to sell self generated electricity to the market and to participate in all electricity markets by providing flexibility to the system for instance through energy storage such as storage using electric vehicles through demand response or through energy efficiency schemes new technology developments will facilitate those activities in the future however legal and commercial barriers exist including for example disproportionate fees for internally consumed electricity obligations to feed self generated electricity to the energy system and administrative burdens such as the need for consumers who self generate electricity and sell it to the system to comply with the requirements for suppliers etc such obstacles which prevent consumers from self generating electricity and from consuming storing or selling self generated electricity to the market should be removed while it should be ensured that such consumers contribute adequately to system costs member states should be able to have different provisions in their national law with respect to taxes and levies for individual and jointly acting active customers as well as for household and other final customers distributed energy technologies and consumer empowerment have made community energy an effective and cost efficient way to meet citizens needs and expectations regarding energy sources services and local participation community energy offers an inclusive option for all consumers to have direct stake in producing consuming or sharing energy community energy initiatives focus primarily on providing affordable energy of specific kind such as renewable energy for their members or shareholders rather than on prioritising profit making like traditional electricity undertaking by directly engaging with consumers community energy initiatives demonstrate their potential to facilitate the uptake of new technologies and consumption patterns including smart distribution grids and demand response in an integrated manner community energy can also advance energy efficiency at household level and help fight energy poverty through reduced consumption and lower supply tariffs community energy also enables certain groups of household customers to participate in the electricity markets who otherwise might not have been able to do so where they have been successfully operated such initiatives have delivered economic social and environmental benefits to the community that go beyond the mere benefits derived from the provision of energy services this directive aims to recognise certain categories of citizen energy initiatives at the union level as citizen energy communities in order to provide them with an enabling framework fair treatment level playing field and well defined catalogue of rights and obligations household customers should be allowed to participate voluntarily in community energy initiatives as well as to leave them without losing access to the network operated by the community energy initiative or losing their rights as consumers access to citizen energy community network should be granted on fair and cost reflective terms membership of citizen energy communities should be open to all categories of entities however the decision making powers within citizen energy community should be limited to those members or shareholders that are not engaged in large scale commercial activity and for which the energy sector does not constitute primary area of economic activity citizen energy communities are considered to be category of cooperation of citizens or local actors that should be subject to recognition and protection under union law the provisions on citizen energy communities do not preclude the existence of other citizen initiatives such as those stemming from private law agreements it should therefore be possible for member states to provide that citizen energy communities take any form of entity for example that of an association cooperative partnership non profit organisation or small or medium sized enterprise provided that the entity is entitled to exercise rights and be subject to obligations in its own name the provisions of this directive on citizen energy communities provide for rights and obligations which are possible to deduce from other existing rights and obligations such as the freedom of contract the right to switch supplier the responsibilities of the distribution system operator the rules on network charges and balancing obligations citizen energy communities constitute new type of entity due to their membership structure governance requirements and purpose they should be allowed to operate on the market on level playing field without distorting competition and the rights and obligations applicable to the other electricity undertakings on the market should be applied to citizen energy communities in non discriminatory and proportionate manner those rights and obligations should apply in accordance with the roles that they undertake such as the roles of final customers producers suppliers or distribution system operators citizen energy communities should not face regulatory restrictions when they apply existing or future information and communications technologies to share electricity produced using generation assets within the citizen energy community among their members or shareholders based on market principles for example by offsetting the energy component of members or shareholders using the generation available within the community even over the public network provided that both metering points belong to the community electricity sharing enables members or shareholders to be supplied with electricity from generating installations within the community without being in direct physical proximity to the generating installation and without being behind single metering point where electricity is shared the sharing should not affect the collection of network charges tariffs and levies related to electricity flows the sharing should be facilitated in accordance with the obligations and correct timeframes for balancing metering and settlement the provisions of this directive on citizen energy communities do not interfere with the competence of member states to design and implement policies relating to the energy sector in relation to network charges and tariffs or to design and implement energy policy financing systems and cost sharing provided that those policies are non discriminatory and lawful this directive empowers member states to allow citizen energy communities to become distribution system operators either under the general regime or as closed distribution system operators once citizen energy community is granted the status of distribution system operator it should be treated as and be subject to the same obligations as distribution system operator the provisions of this directive on citizen energy communities only clarify aspects of distribution system operation that are likely to be relevant for citizen energy communities while other aspects of distribution system operation apply in accordance with the rules relating to distribution system operators electricity bills are an important means by which final customers are informed as well as providing data on consumption and costs they can also convey other information that helps consumers to compare their current arrangements with other offers however disputes over bills are very common source of consumer complaints factor which contributes to the persistently low levels of consumer satisfaction and engagement in the electricity sector it is therefore necessary to make bills clearer and easier to understand as well as to ensure that bills and billing information prominently display limited number of important items of information that are necessary to enable consumers to regulate their energy consumption compare offers and switch supplier other items of information should be made available to final customers in with or signposted to within their bills such items should be displayed on the bill or be in separate document attached to the bill or the bill should contain reference to where the final customer is easily able to find the information on website through mobile application or by other means the regular provision of accurate billing information based on actual electricity consumption facilitated by smart metering is important for helping customers to control their electricity consumption and costs nevertheless customers in particular household customers should have access to flexible arrangements for the actual payment of their bills for example it could be possible for customers to be provided with frequent billing information while paying only on quarterly basis or there could be products for which the customer pays the same amount every month independently of the actual consumption the provisions on billing in directive eu of the european parliament and of the council should be updated streamlined and moved to this directive where they fit more coherently member states should encourage the modernisation of distribution networks such as through the introduction of smart grids which should be built in way that encourages decentralised generation and energy efficiency engaging consumers requires appropriate incentives and technologies such as smart metering systems smart metering systems empower consumers because they allow them to receive accurate and near real time feedback on their energy consumption or generation and to manage their consumption better to participate in and reap benefits from demand response programmes and other services and to lower their electricity bills smart metering systems also enable distribution system operators to have better visibility of their networks and as consequence to reduce their operation and maintenance costs and to pass those savings on to the consumers in the form of lower distribution tariffs when it comes to deciding at national level on the deployment of smart metering systems it should be possible to base this decision on an economic assessment that economic assessment should take into account the long term benefits of the deployment of smart metering systems to consumers and the whole value chain such as better network management more precise planning and identification of network losses should that assessment conclude that the introduction of such metering systems is cost effective only for consumers with certain amount of electricity consumption member states should be able to take that conclusion into account when proceeding with the deployment of smart metering systems however such assessments should be reviewed regularly in response to significant changes in the underlying assumptions or at least every four years given the fast pace of technological developments member states that do not systematically deploy smart metering systems should allow consumers to benefit from the installation of smart meter upon request and under fair and reasonable conditions and should provide them with all the relevant information where consumers do not have smart meters they should be entitled to meters that fulfil the minimum requirements necessary to provide them with the billing information specified in this directive in order to assist consumers active participation in the electricity markets the smart metering systems to be deployed by member states in their territory should be interoperable and should be able to provide data required for consumer energy management systems to that end member states should have due regard to the use of relevant available standards including standards that enable interoperability on the level of the data model and the application layer to best practices and the importance of the development of data exchange to future and innovative energy services to the deployment of smart grids and to the internal market for electricity moreover the smart metering systems that are deployed should not represent barrier to switching supplier and should be equipped with fit for purpose functionalities that allow consumers to have near real time access to their consumption data to modulate their energy consumption and to the extent that the supporting infrastructure permits to offer their flexibility to the network and to electricity undertakings and to be rewarded for it and to obtain savings in their electricity bills key aspect of supplying customers is providing access to objective and transparent consumption data thus consumers should have access to their consumption data and to the prices and service costs associated with their consumption so that they can invite competitors to make offers based on that information consumers should also have the right to be properly informed about their energy consumption prepayments should not place disproportionate disadvantage on their users while different payment systems should be non discriminatory the information on energy costs that is provided to consumers sufficiently frequently would create incentives for energy savings because it would give customers direct feedback on the effects of investment in energy efficiency and on changes of behaviour in that respect the full implementation of directive eu will help consumers to reduce their energy costs currently different models for the management of data have been developed or are under development in member states following deployment of smart metering systems independently of the data management model it is important that member states put in place transparent rules under which data can be accessed under non discriminatory conditions and ensure the highest level of cybersecurity and data protection as well as the impartiality of the entities which process data member states should take the necessary measures to protect vulnerable and energy poor customers in the context of the internal market for electricity such measures may differ according to the particular circumstances in the member states in question and may include social or energy policy measures relating to the payment of electricity bills to investment in the energy efficiency of residential buildings or to consumer protection such as disconnection safeguards where universal service is also provided to small enterprises measures to ensure universal service provision may differ according to whether those measures are aimed at household customers or small enterprises energy services are fundamental to safeguarding the well being of the union citizens adequate warmth cooling and lighting and energy to power appliances are essential services to guarantee decent standard of living and citizens health furthermore access to those energy services enables union citizens to fulfil their potential and enhances social inclusion energy poor households are unable to afford those energy services due to combination of low income high expenditure on energy and poor energy efficiency of their homes member states should collect the right information to monitor the number of households in energy poverty accurate measurement should assist member states in identifying households that are affected by energy poverty in order to provide targeted support the commission should actively support the implementation of the provisions of this directive on energy poverty by facilitating the sharing of good practices between member states where member states are affected by energy poverty and have not developed national action plans or other appropriate frameworks to tackle energy poverty they should do so with the aim of decreasing the number of energy poor customers low income high expenditure on energy and poor energy efficiency of homes are relevant factors in establishing criteria for the measurement of energy poverty in any event member states should ensure the necessary supply for vulnerable and energy poor customers in doing so an integrated approach such as in the framework of energy and social policy could be used and measures could include social policies or energy efficiency improvements for housing this directive should enhance national policies in favour of vulnerable and energy poor customers distribution system operators have to cost efficiently integrate new electricity generation especially installations generating electricity from renewable sources and new loads such as loads that result from heat pumps and electric vehicles for that purpose distribution system operators should be enabled and provided with incentives to use services from distributed energy resources such as demand response and energy storage based on market procedures in order to efficiently operate their networks and to avoid costly network expansions member states should put in place appropriate measures such as national network codes and market rules and should provide incentives to distribution system operators through network tariffs which do not create obstacles to flexibility or to the improvement of energy efficiency in the grid member states should also introduce network development plans for distribution systems in order to support the integration of installations generating electricity from renewable energy sources facilitate the development of energy storage facilities and the electrification of the transport sector and provide to system users adequate information regarding the anticipated expansions or upgrades of the network as currently such procedures do not exist in the majority of member states system operators should not own develop manage or operate energy storage facilities in the new electricity market design energy storage services should be market based and competitive consequently cross subsidisation between energy storage and the regulated functions of distribution or transmission should be avoided such restrictions on the ownership of energy storage facilities is to prevent distortion of competition to eliminate the risk of discrimination to ensure fair access to energy storage services to all market participants and to foster the effective and efficient use of energy storage facilities beyond the operation of the distribution or transmission system that requirement should be interpreted and applied in accordance with the rights and principles established under the charter of fundamental rights of the european union in particular the freedom to conduct business and the right to property guaranteed by articles and of the charter where energy storage facilities are fully integrated network components that are not used for balancing or for congestion management they should not subject to approval by the regulatory authority be required to comply with the same strict limitations for system operators to own develop manage or operate those facilities such fully integrated network components can include energy storage facilities such as capacitors or flywheels which provide important services for network security and reliability and contribute to the synchronisation of different parts of the system with the objective of progress towards completely decarbonised electricity sector that is fully free of emissions it is necessary to make progress in seasonal energy storage such energy storage is an element that would serve as tool for the operation of the electricity system to allow for short term and seasonal adjustment in order to cope with variability in the production of electricity from renewable sources and the associated contingencies in those horizons non discriminatory access to the distribution network determines downstream access to customers at retail level to create level playing field at retail level the activities of distribution system operators should therefore be monitored so that distribution system operators are prevented from taking advantage of their vertical integration as regards their competitive position on the market in particular in relation to household customers and small non household customers where closed distribution system is used to ensure the optimal efficiency of an integrated supply that requires specific operational standards or where closed distribution system is maintained primarily for the use of the owner of the system it should be possible to exempt the distribution system operator from obligations which would constitute an unnecessary administrative burden because of the particular nature of the relationship between the distribution system operator and the system users industrial sites commercial sites or shared services sites such as train station buildings airports hospitals large camping sites with integrated facilities and chemical industry sites can include closed distribution systems because of the specialised nature of their operations without the effective separation of networks from activities of generation and supply there is an inherent risk of discrimination not only in the operation of the network but also in the incentives for vertically integrated undertakings to invest adequately in their networks only the removal of the incentive for vertically integrated undertakings to discriminate against competitors as regards network access and investment can ensure effective unbundling ownership unbundling which implies the appointment of the network owner as the system operator and its independence from any supply and production interests is clearly an effective and stable way to solve the inherent conflict of interests and to ensure security of supply for that reason the european parliament in its resolution of july on prospects for the internal gas and electricity market referred to ownership unbundling at transmission level as the most effective tool for promoting investments in infrastructure in non discriminatory way fair access to the network for new entrants and transparency in the market under ownership unbundling member states should therefore be required to ensure that the same person or persons are not entitled to exercise control over producer or supplier and at the same time exercise control or any right over transmission system operator or transmission system conversely control over transmission system operator or transmission system should preclude the possibility of exercising control or any right over producer or supplier within those limits producer or supplier should be able to have minority shareholding in transmission system operator or transmission system any system for unbundling should be effective in removing any conflict of interests between producers suppliers and transmission system operators in order to create incentives for the necessary investments and to guarantee the access of new market entrants under transparent and efficient regulatory regime and should not create an overly onerous regulatory regime for regulatory authorities since ownership unbundling requires the restructuring of undertakings in some instances member states that decide to implement ownership unbundling should be granted additional time to apply the relevant provisions in view of the vertical links between the electricity and gas sectors the unbundling provisions should apply across the two sectors under ownership unbundling to ensure full independence of network operation from supply and generation interests and to prevent exchanges of any confidential information the same person should not be member of the managing board of both transmission system operator or transmission system and an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply for the same reason the same person should not be entitled to appoint members of the managing boards of transmission system operator or transmission system and to exercise control or any right over producer or supplier the setting up of system operator or transmission operator that is independent from supply and generation interests should enable vertically integrated undertaking to maintain its ownership of network assets while ensuring the effective separation of interests provided that such independent system operator or independent transmission operator performs all of the functions of system operator and provided that detailed regulation and extensive regulatory control mechanisms are put in place where on september an undertaking owning transmission system was part of vertically integrated undertaking member states should be given choice between ownership unbundling and setting up system operator or transmission operator which is independent from supply and generation interests to preserve fully the interests of the shareholders of vertically integrated undertakings member states should have the choice of implementing ownership unbundling either by direct divestments or by splitting the shares of the integrated undertaking into shares of network undertaking and shares of remaining supply and generation undertaking provided that the requirements resulting from ownership unbundling are complied with the full effectiveness of the independent system operator or independent transmission operator solutions should be ensured by way of specific additional rules the rules on independent transmission operators provide an appropriate regulatory framework to guarantee fair competition sufficient investment access for new market entrants and integration of electricity markets effective unbundling through provisions on independent transmission operators should be based on pillar of organisational measures and measures relating to the governance of transmission system operators and on pillar of measures relating to investment to connecting new production capacities to the network and to market integration through regional cooperation the independence of transmission operators should also be ensured inter alia through certain cooling off periods during which no management or other relevant activity giving access to the same information that could have been obtained in managerial position is exercised in the vertically integrated undertaking member states have the right to opt for full ownership unbundling in their territory where member state has exercised that right an undertaking does not have the right to set up an independent system operator or an independent transmission operator furthermore an undertaking performing any of the functions of generation or supply cannot directly or indirectly exercise control or any right over transmission system operator from member state that has opted for full ownership unbundling the implementation of effective unbundling should respect the principle of non discrimination between the public and private sectors to that end the same person should not be able to exercise control or any right in violation of the rules of ownership unbundling or the independent system operator option solely or jointly over the composition voting or decisions of both the bodies of the transmission system operators or the transmission systems and the bodies of the producer or supplier with regard to ownership unbundling and the independent system operator solution provided that the relevant member state is able to demonstrate that the relevant requirements have been complied with two separate public bodies should be able to control generation and supply activities on the one hand and transmission activities on the other fully effective separation of network activities from supply and generation activities should apply throughout the union to both union and non union undertakings to ensure that network activities and supply and generation activities throughout the union remain independent from each other regulatory authorities should be empowered to refuse to certify transmission system operators that do not comply with the unbundling rules to ensure the consistent application of those rules across the union the regulatory authorities should take the utmost account of commission opinions when they take decisions on certification in addition to ensure respect for the international obligations of the union and to ensure solidarity and energy security within the union the commission should have the right to give an opinion on certification in relation to transmission system owner or transmission system operator which is controlled by person or persons from third country or third countries authorisation procedures should not lead to administrative burdens that are disproportionate to the size and potential impact of the producers unduly lengthy authorisation procedures may constitute barrier to access for new market entrants regulatory authorities need to be able to take decisions in relation to all relevant regulatory issues if the internal market for electricity is to function properly and need to be fully independent from any other public or private interests this precludes neither judicial review nor parliamentary supervision in accordance with the constitutional laws of the member states in addition the approval of the budget of the regulatory authority by the national legislator does not constitute an obstacle to budgetary autonomy the provisions relating to the autonomy in the implementation of the allocated budget of the regulatory authority should be implemented in the framework defined by national budgetary law and rules while contributing to the regulatory authorities independence from any political or economic interest through an appropriate rotation scheme it should be possible for member states to take due account of the availability of human resources and of the size of the board regulatory authorities should be able to fix or approve tariffs or the methodologies underlying the calculation of the tariffs on the basis of proposal by the transmission system operator or distribution system operators or on the basis of proposal agreed between those operators and the users of the network in carrying out those tasks regulatory authorities should ensure that transmission and distribution tariffs are non discriminatory and cost reflective and should take account of the long term marginal avoided network costs from distributed generation and demand side management measures regulatory authorities should fix or approve individual grid tariffs for transmission and distribution networks or methodology or both in either case the independence of the regulatory authorities in setting network tariffs pursuant to point of article should be preserved regulatory authorities should ensure that transmission system operators and distribution system operators take appropriate measures to make their network more resilient and flexible to that end they should monitor those operators performance based on indicators such as the capability of transmission system operators and distribution system operators to operate lines under dynamic line rating the development of remote monitoring and real time control of substations the reduction of grid losses and the frequency and duration of power interruptions regulatory authorities should have the power to issue binding decisions in relation to electricity undertakings and to impose effective proportionate and dissuasive penalties on electricity undertakings which fail to comply with their obligations or to propose that competent court impose such penalties on them to that end regulatory authorities should be able to request relevant information from electricity undertakings to conduct appropriate and sufficient investigations and to settle disputes regulatory authorities should also be granted the power to decide irrespective of the application of competition rules on appropriate measures that ensure customer benefits through the promotion of effective competition necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market for electricity regulatory authorities should coordinate among themselves when carrying out their tasks to ensure that the european network of transmission system operators for electricity the european entity for distribution system operators and the regional coordination centres comply with their obligations under the regulatory framework of the internal market for electricity and with decisions of the agency for the cooperation of energy regulators established by regulation of the european parliament and of the council with the expansion of the operational responsibilities of the entso for electricity the eu dso entity and the regional coordination centres it is necessary to enhance oversight with regard to entities that operate at union or regional level regulatory authorities should consult each other and should coordinate their oversight to jointly identify situations where the entso for electricity the eu dso entity or the regional coordination centres do not comply with their respective obligations regulatory authorities should also be granted the power to contribute to ensuring high standards of universal and public service obligations in accordance with market opening to the protection of vulnerable customers and to the full effectiveness of consumer protection measures those provisions should be without prejudice to both the commission powers concerning the application of competition rules including the examination of mergers with union dimension and the rules on the internal market such as the rules on the free movement of capital the independent body to which party affected by the decision of regulatory authority has right to appeal could be court or another tribunal that is empowered to conduct judicial review this directive and directive ec of the european parliament and of the council do not deprive member states of the possibility of establishing and issuing their national energy policy it follows that depending on member state constitutional arrangements it might be within member state competence to determine the policy framework in which the regulatory authorities are to operate for example concerning security of supply however the general energy policy guidelines issued by the member state should not impinge on the independence or autonomy of the regulatory authorities regulation provides for the commission to adopt guidelines or network codes to achieve the necessary degree of harmonisation such guidelines and network codes constitute binding implementing measures and with regard to certain provisions of this directive are useful tool that can be adapted quickly where necessary member states and the contracting parties to the treaty establishing the energy community should cooperate closely on all matters concerning the development of an integrated electricity trading region and should take no measures that endanger the further integration of electricity markets or the security of supply of member states and contracting parties this directive should be read together with regulation which lays down the key principles of the new market design for electricity which will enable better rewards for flexibility provide adequate price signals and ensure the development of functioning integrated short term markets regulation also sets out new rules in various areas including on capacity mechanisms and cooperation between transmission system operators this directive respects the fundamental rights and observes the principles recognised in the charter accordingly this directive should be interpreted and applied in accordance with those rights and principles in particular the right to the protection of personal data guaranteed by article of the charter it is essential that any processing of personal data under this directive comply with regulation of the european parliament and of the council in order to provide the minimum degree of harmonisation required to achieve the aim of this directive the power to adopt acts in accordance with article tfeu should be delegated to the commission to establish rules on the extent of the duties of the regulatory authorities to cooperate with each other and with acer and setting out the details of the procedure for compliance with the network codes and guidelines it is of particular importance that the commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work including at expert level and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the interinstitutional agreement of april on better law making in particular to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts the european parliament and the council receive all documents at the same time as member states experts and their experts systematically have access to meetings of commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of the delegated acts in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this directive implementing powers should be conferred on the commission to determine interoperability requirements and non discriminatory and transparent procedures for access to metering data consumption data as well as data required for customer switching demand response and other services those powers should be exercised in accordance with regulation no of the european parliament and of the council where derogation applies pursuant to article or that derogation should also cover any provisions in this directive that are ancillary to or that require the prior application of any of the provisions from which it has been granted derogation the provisions of directive eu related to electricity markets such as the provisions on metering and billing of electricity demand response priority dispatch and grid access for high efficiency cogeneration are updated by the provisions laid down in this directive and in regulation directive eu should therefore be amended accordingly since the objective of this directive namely the creation of fully operational internal market for electricity cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states but can rather by the reasons of its scale and effects be better achieved at union level the union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article of the treaty on the european union in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article this directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective in accordance with the joint political declaration of september of member states and the commission on explanatory documents member states have undertaken to accompany in justified cases the notification of their transposition measures with one or more documents explaining the relationship between the components of directive and the corresponding parts of national transposition instruments with regard to this directive the legislator considers the transmission of such documents to be justified the obligation to transpose this directive into national law should be confined to those provisions which represent substantive amendment as compared to directive ec the obligation to transpose the provisions which are unchanged arises under directive ec this directive should be without prejudice to the obligations of the member states relating to the time limits for the transposition into national law and the date of application of directive ec set out in annex iii have adopted this directive chapter subject matter and definitions article subject matter this directive establishes common rules for the generation transmission distribution energy storage and supply of electricity together with consumer protection provisions with view to creating truly integrated competitive consumer centred flexible fair and transparent electricity markets in the union using the advantages of an integrated market this directive aims to ensure affordable

organisation and functioning of the union electricity sector in particular rules on consumer empowerment and protection on open access to the integrated market on third party access to transmission and distribution infrastructure unbundling requirements and rules on the independence of regulatory authorities in the member states this directive also sets out modes for member states regulatory

two years of any changes to those measures whether or not they require derogation from this directive member states may decide not to apply articles and of this directive insofar as their application would obstruct in law or in fact the performance of the obligations imposed on electricity undertakings in the general economic interest and insofar as the development of trade would not be affected

sector and repealing directive ec the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee having regard to the opinion of the committee of the regions acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure whereas the electricity sector in the union is undergoing profound transformation characterised by more decentralised markets with more players higher proportion of energy from renewable sources and better interconnected systems in response regulation of the european parliament and of the council and directive of the european parliament and of the council aim to upgrade the legal framework governing the union internal electricity market in order to ensure that markets and networks function in an optimal manner to the benefit of businesses and union citizens this regulation is intended to contribute to the implementation of the objectives of the energy union of which energy security solidarity trust and an ambitious climate policy are an integral part well functioning markets and systems with adequate electricity interconnections are the best guarantee of security of electricity supply however even where markets and systems function well and are interconnected the risk of an electricity crisis as result of natural disasters such as extreme weather conditions malicious attacks or fuel shortages can never be excluded the consequences of electricity crises often extend beyond national borders even where such crises start locally their effects can rapidly spread across borders some extreme circumstances such as cold spells heat waves or cyberattacks may affect entire regions at the same time in context of interlinked electricity markets and systems electricity crisis prevention and management cannot be considered to be purely national task the potential of more efficient and less costly measures through regional cooperation should be better exploited common framework of rules and better coordinated procedures are needed in order to ensure that member states and other actors are able to cooperate effectively across borders in spirit of increased transparency trust and solidarity between member states directive ec of the european parliament and of the council established the necessary measures that the member states are to take in order to ensure security of electricity supply in general the provisions of that directive have largely been superseded by subsequent legislative acts in particular as regards how electricity markets are to be organised in order to ensure the availability of sufficient capacity how transmission system operators are to cooperate to guarantee system stability and as regards ensuring that appropriate infrastructure is in place this regulation addresses the specific issue of electricity crisis prevention and management commission regulations and constitute detailed rulebook governing how transmission system operators and other relevant stakeholders should act and cooperate to ensure system security those technical rules should ensure that most electricity incidents are dealt with effectively at operational level this regulation focuses on electricity crises that have larger scale and impact it sets out what member states should do to prevent such crises and what measures they can take should system operation rules alone no longer suffice even in electricity crises system operation rules should continue to be fully respected and this regulation should be consistent with regulation this regulation sets out common framework of rules on how to prevent prepare for and manage electricity crises bringing more transparency in the preparation phase and during an electricity crisis and ensuring that measures are taken in coordinated and effective manner it requires member states to cooperate at regional level and where applicable bilaterally in spirit of solidarity it also sets out framework for the effective monitoring of security of electricity supply in the union via the electricity coordination group which was set up by commission decision of november as forum in which to exchange information and foster cooperation among member states in particular in the area of security of electricity supply member state cooperation and the monitoring framework are intended to achieve better risk preparedness at lower cost this regulation should also strengthen the internal electricity market by enhancing trust and confidence across member states and ruling out inappropriate state interventions in electricity crises in particular avoiding undue curtailment of cross border flows and cross zonal transmission capacities thus reducing the risk of negative spillover effects on neighbouring member states directive of the european parliament and of the council lays down general rules on security of network and information systems while specific rules on cybersecurity will be developed through network code as laid down in regulation this regulation complements directive by ensuring that cyber incidents are properly identified as risk and that the measures taken to address them are properly reflected in the risk preparedness plans council directive ec lays down process with view to enhancing the security of designated european critical infrastructure including certain electricity infrastructure directive ec together with this regulation contributes to creating comprehensive approach to the energy security of the union decision no eu of the european parliament and of the council sets out requirements for member states to develop risk assessments at national level or at the appropriate sub national level every three years and to develop and refine their disaster risk management planning at national level or at the appropriate sub national level the specific risk prevention preparedness and planning actions set out in this regulation should be consistent with the wider multi hazard national risk assessments required under decision no eu member states are responsible for ensuring the security of electricity supply within their territories while security of electricity supply is also responsibility shared among the commission and other union actors within their respective areas of activity and competence security of electricity supply entails effective cooperation among member states union institutions bodies offices and agencies and relevant stakeholders distribution system operators and transmission system operators play key role in ensuring secure reliable and efficient electricity system in accordance with articles and of directive the regulatory authorities and other relevant national authorities also play an important role in ensuring and monitoring the security of electricity supply as part of their tasks attributed by article of directive member states should designate an existing or new entity as their single competent national governmental or regulatory authority with the aim of ensuring the transparent and inclusive participation of all actors involved the efficient preparation and proper implementation of the risk preparedness plans as well as facilitating the prevention and ex post evaluation of electricity crises and information exchanges in relation thereto common approach to electricity crisis prevention and management requires common understanding among member states as to what constitutes an electricity crisis in particular this regulation should facilitate coordination among member states for the purpose of identifying situation in which the potential risk of significant electricity shortage or an impossibility to supply electricity to customers is present or imminent the european network of transmission system operators for electricity and the member states should respectively determine concrete regional and national electricity crisis scenarios that approach should ensure that all relevant electricity crises are covered taking into account regional and national specificities such as the topology of the grid the electricity mix the size of production and consumption and the degree of population density common approach to electricity crisis prevention and management also requires that member states use the same methods and definitions to identify risks relating to the security of electricity supply and are in position to compare effectively how well they and their neighbours perform in that area this regulation identifies two indicators for monitoring the security of electricity supply in the union expected energy non served expressed in gwh year and loss of load expectation expressed in hours per year those indicators are part of the european resource adequacy assessment carried out by the entso for electricity pursuant to article of regulation the ecg should carry out regular monitoring of the security of electricity supply based on the results of those indicators the agency for the cooperation of energy regulators should also use those indicators when reporting on member states performance in the area of security of electricity supply in its annual electricity market monitoring reports pursuant to article of regulation of the european parliament and of the council to ensure the coherence of risk assessments in manner that builds trust between member states in an electricity crisis common approach to identifying risk scenarios is needed the entso for electricity should therefore after consulting the relevant stakeholders develop and update common methodology for risk identification in cooperation with acer and with the ecg in its formation composed only of representatives of the member states the entso for electricity should propose the methodology and acer should approve it when consulting the ecg acer is to take the utmost account of the views expressed by the ecg the entso for electricity should update the common methodology for risk identification where significant new information becomes available on the basis of the common methodology for risk identification the entso for electricity should regularly draw up and update regional electricity crisis scenarios and identify the most relevant risks for each region such as extreme weather conditions natural disasters fuel shortages or malicious attacks when considering the crisis scenario of gas fuel shortage the risk of disruption of the gas supply should be assessed based on the gas supply and infrastructure disruption scenarios developed by the european network of transmission system operators for gas pursuant to article of regulation of the european parliament and of the council the entso for electricity should be able to delegate tasks relating to the identification of regional electricity crisis scenarios to regional coordination centres established pursuant to article of regulation those delegated tasks should be performed under the supervision of the entso for electricity member states should establish and update their national electricity crisis scenarios on the basis of regional electricity crisis scenarios in principle every four years those scenarios should provide the basis for the risk preparedness plans when identifying risks at national level the member states should describe any risks that they identify in relation to the ownership of the infrastructure relevant for security of electricity supply and any measures taken to address those risks such as general or sector specific investment screening laws special rights for certain shareholders with an indication why they consider such measures to be necessary and proportionate regional approach to identifying risk scenarios and to developing preventive preparatory and mitigating measures should bring significant benefits in terms of the effectiveness of those measures and the optimal use of resources moreover in simultaneous electricity crisis coordinated and pre agreed approach would ensure consistent response and reduce the risk of negative spillover effects that purely national measures could have in neighbouring member states this regulation therefore requires member states to cooperate in regional context the regional coordination centres should perform the tasks of regional relevance assigned to them in accordance with regulation to ensure that they can carry out their tasks effectively and act in close cooperation with relevant national authorities with view to preventing and mitigating larger scale electricity incidents the regional cooperation required under this regulation should build on the regional cooperation structures used at technical level namely the groups of member states sharing the same regional coordination centre the geographical regions of the regional coordination centres are therefore relevant for the identification of the regional electricity crisis scenarios and risk assessments however member states should have the possibility to form subgroups within the regions for the purpose of cooperation with regard to concrete regional measures or to cooperate in existing regional cooperation forums for that purpose as the technical ability to provide mutual assistance to each other in an electricity crisis is essential this is because not all member states in larger region will necessarily be able to provide electricity to another member state in an electricity crisis thus it is not necessary for all member states in region to conclude regional agreements on concrete regional measures instead member states that have the technical ability to provide assistance to each other should conclude such agreements regulation provides for the use of common methodology for the medium to long term european resource adequacy assessment with view to ensuring that member states decisions as to possible investment needs are made on transparent and commonly agreed basis the european resource adequacy assessment has different purpose from the short term adequacy assessments which are used to detect possible adequacy related problems in short time frames namely seasonal adequacy assessments and week ahead to at least day ahead adequacy assessments regarding short term assessments there is need for common approach to the way possible adequacy related problems are detected the entso for electricity should carry out winter and summer adequacy assessments to alert member states and transmission system operators to risks related to the security of electricity supply that might occur in the following six months to improve those adequacy assessments the entso for electricity should develop common probabilistic methodology for them after consulting the relevant stakeholders and in cooperation with acer and with the ecg in its formation composed only of representatives of the member states the entso for electricity should propose that methodology and updates thereto to acer and acer should approve the proposal and the updates when consulting the ecg acer is to take the utmost account of the views expressed by the ecg the entso for electricity should update the methodology where significant new information becomes available the entso for electricity should be able to delegate tasks relating to seasonal adequacy assessments to regional coordination centres while delegated tasks should be performed under the entso for electricity supervision transmission system operators should apply the methodology used to prepare seasonal adequacy assessments when carrying out any other type of short term risk assessment namely the week ahead to at least day ahead generation adequacy forecasts provided for in regulation to ensure common approach to electricity crisis prevention and management the competent authority of each member state should draw up risk preparedness plan on the basis of the regional and national electricity crisis scenarios the competent authorities should consult stakeholders or representatives of stakeholder groups such as representatives of producers or their trade bodies or of distribution system operators where they are relevant for the prevention and handling of an electricity crisis to that end the competent authorities should decide on the appropriate arrangements for carrying out the consultation the risk preparedness plans should describe effective proportionate and non discriminatory measures addressing all identified electricity crisis scenarios the environmental impact of demand side and supply side measures proposed should be taken into account the plans should provide transparency especially as regards the conditions in which non market based measures can be taken to mitigate electricity crises all envisaged non market based measures should comply with the rules laid down in this regulation the risk preparedness plans should be made public while ensuring confidentiality of sensitive information the risk preparedness plans should set out national regional and where applicable bilateral measures regional and where applicable bilateral measures are necessary in particular in the event of simultaneous electricity crisis when coordinated and pre agreed approach is needed to ensure consistent response and reduce the risk of negative spillover effects to that end before adopting the risk preparedness plans competent authorities should consult the competent authorities of the relevant member states the relevant member states are those where there could be negative spillover effects or other impacts on each other electricity system whether those member states are in the same region or directly connected the plans should take account of the relevant national circumstances including the situation of outermost regions within the meaning of article of the treaty on the functioning of the european union and of some micro isolated systems that are not connected to the national transmission systems in that respect member states should draw the appropriate conclusions as regards inter alia the provisions of this regulation on identification of regional electricity crisis scenarios and the regional and bilateral measures set out in risk preparedness plans as well as provisions on assistance the plans should clearly set out the roles and responsibilities of the competent authorities national measures should take full account of the regional and bilateral measures that have been agreed and should take full advantage of the opportunities provided by regional cooperation the plans should be technical and operational in nature their function being to help prevent the occurrence or escalation of an electricity crisis and to mitigate its effects the risk preparedness plans should be updated regularly to ensure that the plans are up to date and effective the competent authorities of the member states of each region should organise biennial simulations of electricity crises in cooperation with transmission system operators and other relevant stakeholders in order to test their suitability the template provided for in this regulation is intended to facilitate the preparation of the plans allowing for the inclusion of additional member state specific information the template is also intended to facilitate consultation of other member states in the region concerned and the ecg consultation within the region and within the ecg should ensure that measures taken in one member state or region do not put at risk the security of electricity supply of other member states or regions it is important to facilitate communication and transparency between member states where they have concrete serious and reliable information that an electricity crisis may occur in such circumstances the member states concerned should inform the commission the neighbouring member states and the ecg without undue delay providing in particular information on the causes of the deterioration of the electricity supply situation the planned measures to prevent the electricity crisis and the possible need for assistance from other member states information exchange in the event of an electricity crisis is essential in order to ensure coordinated action and targeted assistance therefore this regulation obliges the competent authority to inform the member states in the region the neighbouring member states and the commission without undue delay when confronted with an electricity crisis the competent authority should also provide information on the causes of the crisis the measures planned or taken to mitigate the crisis and the possible need for assistance from other member states where that assistance goes beyond security of electricity supply the union civil protection mechanism should remain the applicable legal framework in the event of an electricity crisis member states should cooperate in spirit of solidarity in addition to that general rule appropriate provision should be made for member states to offer each other assistance in an electricity crisis such assistance should be based on agreed coordinated measures set out in the risk preparedness plans this regulation gives member states wide discretion when agreeing on the content of such coordinated measures and thus on the content of the assistance that they offer it is for member states to decide and agree on such coordinated measures taking into account demand and supply at the same time this regulation ensures that for the purpose of the agreed assistance electricity is delivered in coordinated manner member states should agree on the necessary technical legal and financial arrangements for the implementation of the regional and bilateral measures that have been agreed under those technical arrangements the member states should indicate the maximum quantities of electricity to be delivered which should be re assessed on the basis of the technical feasibility of delivering electricity once the assistance is required during an electricity crisis subsequently member states should take all necessary measures for the implementation of the regional and bilateral measures that have been agreed and technical legal and financial arrangements when agreeing on coordinated measures and technical legal and financial arrangements and otherwise implementing provisions on assistance member states should take account of social and economic factors including the security of union citizens and proportionality they are encouraged to exchange best practices and to use the ecg as discussion platform through which to identify the available options for assistance in particular concerning coordinated measures and the necessary technical legal and financial arrangements including fair compensation the commission may facilitate the preparation of the regional and bilateral measures assistance between member states under this regulation should be subject to fair compensation agreed between the member states this regulation does not harmonise all aspects of such fair compensation between member states the member states should therefore agree on provisions on fair compensation before assistance is provided the member state requesting assistance should promptly pay or ensure the prompt payment of such compensation to the member state providing the assistance the commission should provide for non binding guidance on the key elements of fair compensation and other elements of the technical legal and financial arrangements in providing assistance under this regulation member states implement union law and are therefore bound to respect fundamental rights guaranteed by union law such assistance may therefore depending on the measures agreed between member states give rise to an obligation on member state to pay compensation to those affected by its measures member states should therefore where necessary ensure that national compensation rules which comply with union law in particular with fundamental rights are in place moreover the member state that receives assistance should ultimately bear all the reasonable costs that another member state incurs as result of providing assistance pursuant to such national compensation rules in the event of an electricity crisis assistance should be provided even if member states have not yet agreed on coordinated measures and technical legal and financial arrangements as required by the provisions of this regulation on assistance in order to be able to provide assistance in such situation in accordance with this regulation member states should agree on ad hoc measures and arrangements in place of the absent coordinated measures and technical legal and financial arrangements this regulation introduces such an assistance mechanism between member states as an instrument to prevent or mitigate an electricity crisis within the union the commission should therefore review the assistance mechanism in light of future experience with its functioning and propose where appropriate modifications thereto this regulation should enable electricity undertakings and customers to rely on the market mechanisms laid down in regulation and directive for as long as possible when coping with electricity crises rules governing the internal market and system operation rules should be complied with even in electricity crises such rules include point of article of regulation and article of regulation which govern transaction curtailment limitation of provision of cross zonal capacity for capacity allocation or limitation of provision of schedules this means that non market based measures such as forced demand disconnection or the provision of extra supplies outside normal market functioning should be taken only as last resort when all possibilities provided by the market have been exhausted therefore forced demand disconnection should be introduced only after all possibilities for voluntary demand disconnection have been exhausted in addition any non market based measures should be necessary proportionate non discriminatory and temporary in order to ensure transparency after an electricity crisis the competent authority that declared the electricity crisis should carry out an ex post evaluation of the crisis and its impact that evaluation should take into account inter alia the effectiveness and proportionality of the measures taken as well as their economic cost that evaluation should also cover cross border considerations such as the impact of the measures on other member states and the level of the assistance that the member state that declared the electricity crisis received from them the transparency obligations should ensure that all measures that are taken to prevent or manage electricity crises comply with internal market rules and are in line with the principles of cooperation and solidarity which underpin the energy union this regulation reinforces the role of the ecg it should carry out specific tasks in particular in connection with the development of methodology for identifying regional electricity crisis scenarios and methodology for short term and seasonal adequacy assessments and in connection with the preparation of the risk preparedness plans and should have prominent role in monitoring member states performance in the area of the security of electricity supply and developing best practices on that basis it is possible that an electricity crisis extends beyond union borders to the territory of the energy community contracting parties as party to the treaty establishing the energy community the union should promote amendments to that treaty with the aim of creating an integrated market and single regulatory space by providing an appropriate and stable regulatory framework in order to ensure efficient crisis management the union should closely cooperate with the energy community contracting parties when preventing preparing for and managing an electricity crisis where the commission acer the ecg the entso for electricity member states and their competent and regulatory authorities or any other bodies entities or persons receive confidential information pursuant to this regulation they should ensure the confidentiality of that information to that end confidential information should be subject to union and national rules in place on the handling of confidential information and processes since the objective of this regulation namely to ensure the most effective and efficient risk preparedness within the union cannot be sufficiently achieved by member states but can rather by reason of its scale and effects be better achieved at union level the union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article of the treaty on european union in accordance with the principle of proportionality set out in that article this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective cyprus is currently the only member state which is not directly connected to another member state it should be clarified with respect to certain provisions of this regulation that for as long as this situation persists those provisions namely provisions on the identification of regional electricity crisis scenarios on including regional and bilateral measures set out in risk preparedness plans and on assistance do not apply with respect to cyprus cyprus and relevant other member states are encouraged to develop with the support of the commission alternative measures and procedures in the fields covered by those provisions provided that such alternative measures and procedures do not affect the effective application of this regulation between the other member states directive ec should be repealed have adopted this regulation chapter general provisions article subject matter this regulation lays down rules for cooperation between member states with view to preventing preparing for and managing electricity crises in spirit of solidarity

regulation of the european parliament and of the council of june on the internal market for electricity the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee having regard to the opinion of the committee of the regions acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure whereas regulation no of the european parliament and of the council has been substantially amended several times since further amendments are to be made that regulation should be recast in the interests of clarity the energy union aims to provide final customers household and business with safe secure sustainable competitive and affordable energy historically the electricity system was dominated by vertically integrated often publicly owned monopolies with large centralised nuclear or fossil fuel power plants the internal market for electricity which has been progressively implemented since aims to deliver real choice for all consumers in the union new business opportunities and more cross border trade so as to achieve efficiency gains competitive prices and higher standards of service and to contribute to security of supply and sustainability the internal market for electricity has increased competition in particular at the wholesale level and cross zonal trade it remains the foundation of an efficient energy market the union energy system is in the middle of its most profound change in decades and the electricity market is at the heart of that change the common goal of decarbonising the energy system creates new opportunities and challenges for market participants at the same time technological developments allow for new forms of consumer participation and cross border cooperation this regulation establishes rules to ensure the functioning of the internal market for electricity and includes requirements related to the development of renewable forms of energy and environmental policy in particular specific rules for certain types of renewable power generating facilities concerning balancing responsibility dispatch and redispatching as well as threshold for co emissions of new generation capacity where such capacity is subject to temporary measures to ensure the necessary level of resource adequacy namely capacity mechanisms electricity from renewable sources from small power generating facilities should be granted priority dispatch either via specific priority order in the dispatching methodology or via legal or regulatory requirements for market operators to provide this electricity on the market priority dispatch which has been granted in the system operation services under the same economic conditions should be considered to comply with this regulation in any case priority dispatch should be deemed to be compatible with the participation in the electricity market of power generating facilities using renewable energy sources state interventions often designed in an uncoordinated manner have led to increasing distortions of the wholesale electricity market with negative consequences for investments and cross border trade in the past electricity customers were purely passive often buying electricity at regulated prices which had no direct relation to the market in the future customers need to be enabled to fully participate in the market on equal footing with other market participants and need to be empowered to manage their energy consumption to integrate the growing share of renewable energy the future electricity system should make use of all available sources of flexibility particularly demand side solutions and energy storage and should make use of digitalisation through the integration of innovative technologies with the electricity system to achieve effective decarbonisation at the lowest cost the future electricity system also needs to encourage energy efficiency the completion of the internal energy market through the effective integration of renewable energy can drive investments in the long term and can contribute to delivering the objectives of the energy union and the climate and energy framework as set out in the commission communication of january entitled policy framework for climate and energy in the period from to and endorsed in the conclusions adopted by the european council at its meeting on and october more market integration and the change towards more volatile electricity production requires increased efforts to coordinate national energy policies with neighbours and to use the opportunities of cross border electricity trade regulatory frameworks have developed allowing electricity to be traded across the union that development has been supported by the adoption of several network codes and guidelines for the integration of the electricity markets those network codes and guidelines contain provisions on market rules system operation and network connection to ensure full transparency and increase legal certainty the main principles of market functioning and capacity allocation in the balancing intraday day ahead and forward market timeframes should also be adopted pursuant to the ordinary legislative procedure and incorporated in union legislative single act article of commission regulation establishes process whereby transmission system operators are able to delegate all or part of their tasks to third party the delegating transmission system operators should remain responsible for ensuring compliance with this regulation moreover member states should be able to assign tasks and obligations to third party such assignment should be limited to tasks and obligations carried out at national level such as imbalance settlement the limitations on such assignment should not lead to unnecessary changes to existing national arrangements however transmission system operators should remain responsible for the tasks entrusted to them under article of directive of the european parliament and of the council with regard to balancing markets efficient and non distortive price formation in the procurement of balancing capacity and balancing energy requires that balancing capacity contracts do not set the price for balancing energy this is without prejudice for the dispatching systems using an integrated scheduling process in accordance with regulation articles and of regulation establish that the pricing method for both standard and specific products for balancing energy should create positive incentives for market participants in keeping their own balance or helping to restore the system balance in their imbalance price area thereby reducing system imbalances and costs to society such pricing approaches should strive for the economically efficient use of demand response and other balancing resources subject to operational security limits the integration of balancing energy markets should facilitate the efficient functioning of the intraday market in order to provide the possibility for market participants to balance themselves as closely as possible to real time enabled by the balancing energy gate closure times provided for in article of regulation only the imbalances remaining after the end of the intraday market should be balanced by transmission system operators in the balancing market article of regulation also provides for the harmonisation of the imbalance settlement period at minutes in the union that harmonisation is intended to support intraday trading and foster the development of number of trading products with the same delivery windows in order to enable transmission system operators to procure and use balancing capacity in an efficient economic and market based manner there is need to foster market integration in that regard title iv of regulation establishes three methodologies through which transmission system operators are entitled to allocate cross zonal capacity for the exchange of balancing capacity and the sharing of reserves when supported on the basis of cost benefit analysis the co optimisation process the market based allocation process and the allocation based on an economic efficiency analysis the co optimisation allocation process is to be performed on day ahead basis by contrast it is possible to perform the market based allocation process where the contracting is carried out not more than one week in advance of the provision of the balancing capacity and to perform the allocation based on an economic efficiency analysis where the contracting is done more than one week in advance of the provision of the balancing capacity provided that the volumes allocated are limited and that an assessment is carried out annually once methodology for the process of allocating cross zonal capacity is approved by the relevant regulatory authorities early application of that methodology by two or more transmission system operators could take place to allow them to gain experience and to allow for the smooth application of that methodology by more transmission system operators in the future the application of such methodologies should nevertheless be harmonised by all transmission system operators in order to foster market integration title of regulation established that the general objective of imbalance settlement is to ensure that balance responsible parties keep their own balance or help restore the system balance in an efficient way and to provide incentives to market participants for keeping or helping to restore the system balance to make balancing markets and the overall energy system fit for the integration of the increasing share of variable renewable energy imbalance prices should reflect the real time value of energy all market participants should be financially responsible for the imbalances they cause in the system representing the difference between the allocated volume and the final position in the market for demand response aggregators the allocated volume consists of the volume of energy physically activated by the participating customers load based on defined measurement and baseline methodology commission regulation sets out detailed guidelines on cross zonal capacity allocation and congestion management in the day ahead and intraday markets including the requirements for the establishment of common methodologies for determining the volumes of capacity simultaneously available between bidding zones criteria to assess efficiency and review process for defining bidding zones articles and of regulation set out rules on review of bidding zone configuration articles and thereof set out harmonised limits on maximum and minimum clearing prices for day ahead and intraday timeframes article thereof sets out rules on intraday cross zonal gate closure times whereas article thereof sets out rules on redispatching and countertrading cost sharing methodologies commission regulation sets out detailed rules on cross zonal capacity allocation in the forward markets on the establishment of common methodology to determine long term cross zonal capacity on the establishment of single allocation platform at european level offering long term transmission rights and on the possibility to return long term transmission rights for subsequent forward capacity allocation or to transfer long term transmission rights between market participants article of regulation sets out rules on forward hedging products commission regulation sets out the requirements for grid connection of power generating facilities to the interconnected system in particular with respect to synchronous power generating modules power park modules and offshore power park modules those requirements help to ensure fair conditions of competition in the internal electricity market to ensure system security and the integration of electricity from renewable sources and to facilitate union wide trade in electricity articles and of regulation set out rules for emerging technologies in electricity generation bidding zones reflecting supply and demand distribution are cornerstone of market based electricity trading and are prerequisite for reaching the full potential of capacity allocation methods including the flow based approach bidding zones therefore should be defined in manner to ensure market liquidity efficient congestion management and overall market efficiency when review of an existing bidding zone configuration is launched by single regulatory authority or transmission system operator with the approval of its competent regulatory authority for the bidding zones inside the transmission system operator control area if the bidding zone configuration has negligible impact on neighbouring transmission system operators control areas including interconnectors and the review of bidding zone configuration is necessary to improve efficiency to maximise cross border trading opportunities or to maintain operational security the transmission system operator in the relevant control area and the competent regulatory authority should be respectively the only transmission system operator and the only regulatory authority participating in the review the relevant transmission system operator and the competent regulatory authority should give the neighbouring transmission system operators prior notice of the review and the results of the review should be published it should be possible to launch regional bidding zone review following the technical report on congestion in line with article of this regulation or in accordance with existing procedures laid down in regulation when regional coordination centres carry out capacity calculation they should maximise capacity considering non costly remedial actions and respecting the operational security limits of transmission system operators in the capacity calculation region where the calculation does not result in capacity equal to or above the minimum capacities set out in this regulation regional coordination centres should consider all available costly remedial actions to further increase capacity up to the minimum capacities including redispatching potential within and between the capacity calculation regions while respecting the operational security limits of transmission system operators of the capacity calculation regions transmission system operators should report accurately and transparently on all aspects of capacity calculation in accordance with this regulation and should ensure that all information sent to regional coordination centres is accurate and fit for purpose when performing capacity calculation regional coordination centres should calculate cross zonal capacities using data from transmission system operators which respects the operational security limits of the transmission system operators respective control areas transmission system operators should be able to deviate from coordinated capacity calculation where its implementation would result in violation of the operational security limits of network elements in their control area those deviations should be carefully monitored and transparently reported to prevent abuse and ensure that the volume of interconnection capacity to be made available to market participants is not limited in order to solve congestion inside bidding zone where an action plan is in place the action plan should take account of deviations and address their cause core market principles should set out that electricity prices are to be determined through demand and supply those prices should indicate when electricity is needed thereby providing market based incentives for investments into flexibility sources such as flexible generation interconnection demand response or energy storage while decarbonisation of the electricity sector with energy from renewable sources becoming major part of the market is one of the goals of the energy union it is crucial that the market removes existing barriers to cross border trade and encourages investments into supporting infrastructure for example more flexible generation interconnection demand response and energy storage to support this shift to variable and distributed generation and to ensure that energy market principles are the basis for the union electricity markets of the future renewed focus on short term markets and scarcity pricing is essential short term markets improve liquidity and competition by enabling more resources to participate fully in the market especially those resources that are more flexible effective scarcity pricing will encourage market participants to react to market signals and to be available when the market most needs them and ensures that they can recover their costs in the wholesale market it is therefore critical to ensure that administrative and implicit price caps are removed in order to allow for scarcity pricing when fully embedded in the market structure short term markets and scarcity pricing contribute to the removal of other market distortive measures such as capacity mechanisms in order to ensure security of supply at the same time scarcity pricing without price caps on the wholesale market should not jeopardize the possibility of offering reliable and stable prices to final customers in particular household customers small and medium sized enterprises and industrial customers without prejudice to articles and of the treaty on the functioning of the european union derogations from fundamental market principles such as balancing responsibility market based dispatch or redispatch reduce flexibility signals and act as barriers to the development of solutions such as energy storage demand response or aggregation while derogations are still necessary to avoid an unnecessary administrative burden to certain market participants in particular household customers and smes broad derogations covering entire technologies are not consistent with the aim of achieving efficient market based decarbonisation processes and should thus be replaced by more targeted measures precondition for effective competition in the internal market for electricity is non discriminatory transparent and adequate charges for network use including interconnecting lines in the transmission system uncoordinated curtailments of interconnector capacities increasingly limit the exchange of electricity between member states and have become serious obstacle to the development of functioning internal market for electricity the maximum level of capacity of interconnectors and the critical network elements should therefore be made available complying with the safety standards of secure network operation including respecting the security standard for contingencies however there are some limitations to setting the capacity level in meshed grid clear minimum levels of available capacity for cross zonal trade need to be put in place in order to reduce the effects of loop flows and internal congestions on cross zonal trade and to give predictable capacity value for market participants where the flow based approach is used that minimum capacity should determine the minimum share of the capacity of cross zonal or an internal critical network element respecting operational security limits to be used as an input for coordinated capacity calculation under regulation taking into account contingencies the total remaining share of capacity may be used for reliability margins loop flows and internal flows furthermore in the case of foreseeable problems for ensuring grid security derogations should be possible for limited transitional phase such derogations should be accompanied by methodology and projects providing for long term solution the transmission capacity to which the minimum capacity criterion shall apply in the net transmission capacity approach is the maximum transmission of active power which respects operational security limits and takes into account contingencies the coordinated calculation of this capacity also takes into account that electricity flows are distributed unevenly between individual components and is not just adding capacities of interconnecting lines this capacity does not take into account the reliability margin loop flows or internal flows which are taken into account within the remaining it is important to avoid distortion of competition resulting from the differing safety operational and planning standards used by transmission system operators in member states moreover there should be transparency for market participants concerning available transfer capacities and the security planning and operational standards that affect the available transfer capacities to efficiently steer necessary investments prices also need to provide signals where electricity is most needed in zonal electricity system correct locational signals require coherent objective and reliable determination of bidding zones via transparent process in order to ensure efficient operation and planning of the union electricity network and to provide effective price signals for new generation capacity demand response and transmission infrastructure bidding zones should reflect structural congestion in particular cross zonal capacity should not be reduced in order to resolve internal congestion to reflect the divergent principles of optimising bidding zones without jeopardising liquid markets and grid investments two options should be provided for in order to address congestion member states should be able to choose between reconfiguration of their bidding zone or measures such as grid reinforcement and grid optimisation the starting point for such decision should be the identification of long term structural congestions by the transmission system operator or operators of member state by report by the european network of transmission system operators for electricity on congestion or by bidding zone review member states should first try to find common solution on how to best address congestion in the course of doing so member states might adopt multinational or national action plans to address congestion for member states which adopt an action plan to address congestion phase in period in the form of linear trajectory for the opening of interconnectors should apply at the end of the implementation of such an action plan member states should have possibility to choose whether to opt for reconfiguration of the bidding zone or whether to opt for addressing remaining congestion through remedial actions for which they bear the costs in the latter case their bidding zone should not be reconfigured against the will of that member state provided that the minimum capacity is reached the minimum level of capacity that should be used in coordinated capacity calculation should be percentage of the capacity of critical network element as defined following the selection process under regulation after or in the case of flow based approach while respecting the operational security limits in contingency situations commission decision on the configuration of bidding zone should be possible as measure of last resort and should only amend the configuration of bidding zone in those member states which have opted to split the bidding zone or which have not reached the minimum level of the capacity efficient decarbonisation of the electricity system via market integration requires systematically abolishing barriers to cross border trade to overcome market fragmentation and to allow union energy customers to fully benefit from the advantages of integrated electricity markets and competition this regulation should lay down basic principles with regard to tarification and capacity allocation while providing for the adoption of guidelines detailing further relevant principles and methodologies in order to allow rapid adaptation to changed circumstances the management of congestion problems should provide correct economic signals to transmission system operators and market participants and should be based on market mechanisms in an open competitive market transmission system operators should be compensated for costs incurred as result of hosting cross border flows of electricity on their networks by the operators of the transmission systems from which cross border flows originate and the systems where those flows end payments and receipts resulting from compensation between transmission system operators should be taken into account when setting national network tariffs the actual amount payable for cross border access to the system can vary considerably depending on the transmission system operator involved and as result of differences in the structure of the tarification systems applied in member states certain degree of harmonisation is therefore necessary in order to avoid distortions of trade there should be rules on the use of revenues from congestion management procedures unless the specific nature of the interconnector concerned justifies an exemption from those rules to provide for level playing field between all market participants network tariffs should be applied in way which does not positively or negatively discriminate between production connected at the distribution level and production connected at the transmission level network tariffs should not discriminate against energy storage and should not create disincentives for participation in demand response or represent an obstacle to improving energy efficiency in order to increase transparency and comparability in tariff setting where binding harmonisation is not seen as adequate best practices report on tariff methodologies should be issued by the european agency for the cooperation of energy regulators established by regulation of the european parliament and of the council to better ensure optimal investment in the trans european grid and to better address the challenge where viable interconnection projects cannot be built for lack of prioritisation at national level the use of congestion rents should be reconsidered and contribute to guarantee availability and maintain or increase interconnection capacities in order to ensure optimal management of the electricity transmission network and to allow trading and supplying electricity across borders in the union the entso for electricity should be established the tasks of the entso for electricity should be carried out in accordance with union competition rules which remain applicable to the decisions of the entso for electricity the tasks of the entso for electricity should be well defined and its working method should ensure efficiency and transparency the network codes prepared by the entso for electricity are not intended to replace the necessary national network codes for non cross border issues given that more effective progress may be achieved through an approach at regional level transmission system operators should set up regional structures within the overall cooperation structure whilst ensuring that results at regional level are compatible with network codes and non binding ten year network development plans at union level member states should promote cooperation and monitor the effectiveness of the network at regional level cooperation at regional level should be compatible with progress towards competitive and efficient internal market for electricity the entso for electricity should carry out robust medium to long term european resource adequacy assessment to provide an objective basis for the assessment of adequacy concerns the resource adequacy concern that capacity mechanisms address should be based on the european resource adequacy assessment that assessment may be complemented by national assessments the methodology for the long term resource adequacy assessment set out in this regulation has different purpose than the seasonal adequacy assessments as set out in article of regulation of the european parliament and of the council medium to long term assessments are mainly used to identify adequacy concerns and to assess the need for capacity mechanisms whereas seasonal adequacy assessments are used to alert to short term risks that might occur in the following six months that are likely to result in significant deterioration of the electricity supply situation in addition regional coordination centres also carry out regional adequacy assessments on electricity transmission system operation those are very short term adequacy assessments used in the context of system operation before introducing capacity mechanisms member states should assess the regulatory distortions contributing to the related resource adequacy concern member states should be required to adopt measures to eliminate the identified distortions and should adopt timeline for their implementation capacity mechanisms should only be introduced to address the adequacy problems that cannot be solved through the removal of such distortions member states intending to introduce capacity mechanisms should derive resource adequacy targets on the basis of transparent and verifiable process member states should have the freedom to set their own desired level of security of supply pursuant to article tfeu the commission has exclusive competence to assess the compatibility with the internal market of state aid measures which the member states may put in place that assessment is to be carried out on the basis of article tfeu and in accordance with the relevant provisions and guidelines which the commission may adopt to that effect this regulation is without prejudice to the commission exclusive competence conferred by tfeu capacity mechanisms that are in place should be reviewed in light of this regulation detailed rules for facilitating effective cross border participation in capacity mechanisms should be laid down in this regulation transmission system operators should facilitate the cross border participation of interested producers in capacity mechanisms in other member states therefore they should calculate capacities up to which cross border participation would be possible should enable participation and should check availabilities regulatory authorities should enforce the cross border rules in the member states capacity mechanisms should not result in overcompensation while at the same time they should ensure security of supply in that regard capacity mechanisms other than strategic reserves should be constructed to ensure that the price paid for availability automatically tends to zero when the level of capacity which would be profitable on the energy market in the absence of capacity mechanism is expected to be adequate to meet the level of capacity demanded to support member states and regions facing social industrial and economic challenges due to the energy transition the commission has set up coal and carbon intensive regions initiative in that context the commission should assist member states including with targeted financial support to enable just transition in those regions where available in view of the differences between national energy systems and the technical limitations of existing electricity networks the best approach to achieving progress in market integration is often at regional level regional cooperation between transmission system operators should thus be strengthened in order to ensure efficient cooperation new regulatory framework should provide for stronger regional governance and regulatory oversight including by strengthening acer decision making power with respect to cross border issues it is possible that closer cooperation of member states is also needed in crisis situations to increase security of supply and to limit market distortions coordination between transmission system operators at regional level has been formalised with the mandatory participation of transmission system operators in regional security coordinators the regional coordination of transmission system operators should be further developed with an enhanced institutional framework via the establishment of regional coordination centres the establishment of regional coordination centres should take into account existing or planned regional coordination initiatives and should support the increasingly integrated operation of electricity systems across the union thereby ensuring their efficient and secure performance for that reason it is necessary to ensure that the coordination of transmission system operators through regional coordination centres takes place across the union where transmission system operators of given region are not yet coordinated by an existing or planned regional coordination centre the transmission system operators in that region should establish or designate regional coordination centre the geographical scope of regional coordination centres should allow them to contribute effectively to the coordination of the operations of transmission system operators across regions and should lead to enhanced system security and market efficiency regional coordination centres should have the flexibility to carry out their tasks in the region in the way which is best adapted to the nature of the individual tasks entrusted to them regional coordination centres should carry out tasks where their regionalisation brings added value compared to tasks performed at national level the tasks of regional coordination centres should cover the tasks carried out by regional security coordinators pursuant to the commission regulation as well as additional system operation market operation and risk preparedness tasks the tasks carried out by regional coordination centres should not include real time operation of the electricity system in performing their tasks regional coordination centres should contribute to the achievement of the and objectives set out in the climate and energy policy framework regional coordination centres should primarily act in the interest of system and market operation of the region hence regional coordination centres should be entrusted with the powers necessary to coordinate the actions to be taken by transmission system operators of the system operation region for certain functions and with an enhanced advisory role for the remaining functions the human technical physical and financial resources of regional coordination centres should not exceed what is strictly necessary for the fulfilment of their tasks the entso for electricity should ensure that the activities of regional coordination centres are coordinated across regional boundaries in order to increase efficiencies in the electricity distribution networks in the union and to ensure close cooperation with transmission system operators and the entso for electricity an entity of distribution system operators in the union should be established the tasks of the eu dso entity should be well defined and its working method should ensure efficiency transparency and representativeness among union distribution system operators the eu dso entity should closely cooperate with the entso for electricity on the preparation and implementation of the network codes where applicable and should work on providing guidance on the integration inter alia of distributed generation and energy storage in distribution networks or other areas which relate to the management of distribution networks the eu dso entity should also take due account of the specificities inherent to distribution systems connected downstream with electricity systems on islands which are not connected with other electricity systems by means of interconnectors increased cooperation and coordination among transmission system operators is required to create network codes for providing and managing effective and transparent access to the transmission networks across borders and to ensure coordinated and sufficiently forward looking planning and sound technical evolution of the transmission system in the union including the creation of interconnection capacities with due regard to the environment those network codes should be in line with non binding framework guidelines which are developed by acer acer should have role in reviewing based on matters of fact draft network codes including their compliance with those framework guidelines and it should be enabled to recommend them for adoption by the commission acer should assess proposed amendments to the network codes and it should be enabled to recommend them for adoption by the commission transmission system operators should operate their networks in accordance with those network codes experience with the development and adoption of network codes has shown that it is useful to streamline the development procedure by clarifying that acer has the right to revise draft electricity network codes before submitting them to the commission to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market for electricity provision should be made for procedures which allow the adoption of decisions and guidelines with regard inter alia to tarification and capacity allocation by the commission whilst ensuring the involvement of regulatory authorities in that process where appropriate through their association at union level regulatory authorities together with other relevant authorities in the member states have an important role to play in contributing to the proper functioning of the internal market for electricity all market participants have an interest in the work expected of the entso for electricity an effective consultation process is therefore essential and existing structures that are set up to facilitate and streamline the consultation process such as via regulatory authorities or acer should play an important role in order to ensure greater transparency regarding the entire electricity transmission network in the union the entso for electricity should draw up publish and regularly update non binding union wide ten year network development plan viable electricity transmission networks and necessary regional interconnections relevant from commercial or security of supply point of view should be included in that network development plan investments in major new infrastructure should be promoted strongly while ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market for electricity in order to enhance the positive effect of exempted direct current interconnectors on competition and security of supply market interest during the project planning phase should be tested and congestion management rules should be adopted where direct current interconnectors are located in the territory of more than one member state acer should handle as last resort the exemption request in order to take better account of its cross border implications and to facilitate its administrative handling moreover given the exceptional risk profile of constructing those exempt major infrastructure projects undertakings with supply and production interests should be able to benefit from temporary derogation from the full unbundling rules for the projects concerned exemptions granted under regulation no of the european parliament and of the council continue to apply until the scheduled expiry date as decided in the granted exemption decision offshore electricity infrastructure with dual functionality combining transport of offshore wind energy to shore and interconnectors should also be eligible for exemption such as under the rules applicable to new direct current interconnectors where necessary the regulatory framework should duly consider the specific situation of those assets to overcome barriers to the realisation of societally cost efficient offshore hybrid assets to enhance trust in the market its participants need to be sure that those engaging in abusive behaviour can be subject to effective proportionate and dissuasive penalties the competent authorities should be given the competence to investigate effectively allegations of market abuse to that end it is necessary that competent authorities have access to data that provides information on operational decisions made by suppliers in the electricity market many relevant decisions are made by the producers which should keep information in relation to those decisions available to and easily accessible by the competent authorities for set period the competent authorities should furthermore regularly monitor whether the transmission system operators comply with the rules small producers with no real ability to distort the market should be exempt from that obligation the member states and the competent authorities should be required to provide relevant information to the commission such information should be treated confidentially by the commission where necessary the commission should have an opportunity to request relevant information directly from undertakings concerned provided that the competent authorities are informed member states should lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the provisions of this regulation and ensure that they are implemented those penalties should be effective proportionate and dissuasive member states the energy community contracting parties and other third countries which apply this regulation or are part of the synchronous area of continental europe should closely cooperate on all matters concerning the development of an integrated electricity trading region and should take no measures that endanger the further integration of electricity markets or security of supply of member states and contracting parties at the time of the adoption of regulation no only few rules for the internal market for electricity existed at union level since then the union internal market has become more complex due to the fundamental change the markets are undergoing in particular regarding deployment of variable renewable electricity production the network codes and guidelines have therefore become extensive and comprehensive and encompass both technical and general issues in order to ensure the minimum degree of harmonisation required for effective market functioning the power to adopt acts in accordance with article of tfeu should be delegated to the commission in respect of non essential elements of certain specific areas which are fundamental for market integration those acts should include the adoption and amendment of certain network codes and guidelines where they supplement this regulation the regional cooperation of transmission system operators and regulatory authorities financial compensations between transmission system operators as well as the application of exemption provisions for new interconnectors it is of particular importance that the commission carry out appropriate consultations during its preparatory work including at expert level and that those consultations be conducted in accordance with the principles laid down in the interinstitutional agreement of april on better law making in particular to ensure equal participation in the preparation of delegated acts the european parliament and the council receive all documents at the same time as member states experts and their experts systematically have access to meetings of commission expert groups dealing with the preparation of delegated acts in order to ensure uniform conditions for the implementation of this regulation implementing powers in accordance with article of tfeu should be conferred on the commission those powers should be exercised in accordance with regulation no of the european parliament and of the council the examination procedure should be used for the adoption of those implementing acts since the objective of this regulation namely the provision of harmonised framework for cross border exchanges of electricity cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states but can rather by reason of its scale and effects be better achieved at union level the union may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in article of the treaty on european union in accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that article this regulation does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective for reasons of coherence and legal certainty no provision in this regulation should prevent the application of the derogations emerging from article of directive have adopted this regulation chapter subject matter scope and definitions article subject matter and scope this regulation aims to set the basis for an efficient achievement of the objectives of the energy union and in particular the climate and energy framework for by enabling market signals to be delivered for increased efficiency higher share of renewable

providers and electricity customers non discriminatory market access empower consumers ensure competitiveness on the global market as well as demand response energy storage and energy efficiency and facilitate aggregation of distributed demand and supply and enable market and sectoral integration and market based remuneration of electricity generated from renewable sources set fair rules for

of those measures on neighbouring control areas and coordinate such measures with other affected transmission system operators as provided for in regulation transaction curtailment procedures shall be used only in emergency situations namely where the transmission system operator must act in an expeditious manner and redispatching or countertrading is not possible any such procedure shall be applied in non discriminatory manner except in cases of force majeure market participants that have been allocated capacity shall be compensated for any such curtailment regional coordination centres shall carry out coordinated capacity calculation in accordance with paragraphs and of this article as provided for in point of article and in article regional coordination centres shall calculate

trade are reached for borders using coordinated net transmission capacity approach the minimum capacity shall be of the transmission capacity respecting operational security limits after deduction of contingencies as determined in accordance with the capacity allocation and congestion management guideline adopted on the basis of article of regulation no for borders using flow based approach the

derogations which shall not relate to the curtailment of capacities already allocated pursuant to paragraph shall be granted for no more than one year at time or provided that the extent of the derogation decreases significantly after the first year up to maximum of two years the extent of such derogations shall be strictly limited to what is necessary to maintain operational security and they shall avoid discrimination between internal and cross zonal exchanges before granting derogation the relevant regulatory authority shall consult the regulatory authorities of other member states forming part of the affected capacity calculation regions where regulatory authority disagrees with the proposed derogation acer shall decide whether it should be granted pursuant to point of article of regulation the justification and reasons for the derogation shall be published where derogation is granted the relevant transmission system operators shall develop and publish methodology and projects that shall provide long term solution to the issue that the derogation seeks to address the derogation shall expire when the time limit for the derogation is reached or when the solution is applied whichever is earlier market participants shall inform the transmission system operators concerned within reasonable period in advance of the relevant operational period whether they intend to use allocated capacity any allocated capacity that is not going to be used shall be made available again to the market in an open transparent and non discriminatory manner as far as technically possible transmission system operators shall net the capacity requirements of any power flows in opposite directions over the congested interconnection line in order to use that line to its maximum capacity having full regard to network security transactions that relieve the congestion shall not be refused the financial consequences of failure to honour obligations associated with the allocation of capacity shall be attributed to the transmission system operators or nemos who are responsible for such failure where market participants fail to use the capacity that they have committed to use or in the case of explicitly auctioned capacity fail to trade capacity on secondary basis or give the capacity back in due time those market participants shall lose the rights to such capacity and shall pay cost reflective charge any cost reflective charges for the failure to use capacity shall be justified and proportionate if transmission system operator does not fulfil its obligation of providing firm transmission capacity it shall be liable to compensate the market participant for the loss of capacity rights consequential losses shall not be taken into account for that purpose the key concepts and methods for the determination of liabilities that accrue upon failure to honour obligations shall be set out in advance in respect of the financial consequences and shall be subject to review by the relevant regulatory authority when allocating costs of remedial actions between transmission system operators regulatory authorities shall analyse to what extent flows resulting from transactions internal to bidding zones contribute to the congestion between two bidding zones observed and allocate the costs based on the contribution to the congestion to the transmission system

journal of the european union regulation of the european parliament and of the council of june establishing european union agency for the cooperation of energy regulators the european parliament and the council of the european union having regard to the treaty on the functioning of the european union and in particular article thereof having regard to the proposal from the european commission after transmission of the draft legislative act to the national parliaments having regard to the opinion of the european economic and social committee having regard to the opinion of the committee of the regions acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure whereas regulation no of the european parliament and of the council which established the agency for the cooperation of energy regulators has been substantially amended since further amendments are to be made that regulation should be recast in the interest of clarity the creation of acer has manifestly improved coordination between regulatory authorities on cross border issues since its creation acer has received new important tasks concerning the monitoring of wholesale markets under regulation no of the european parliament and of the council and concerning the fields of cross border energy infrastructure under regulation no of the european parliament and of the council and security of gas supply under regulation of the european parliament and of the council it is anticipated that the need for coordination of national regulatory actions will increase further in the coming years the union energy system is in the middle of its most profound change in decades more market integration and the change towards more variable electricity production require increased efforts to coordinate national energy policies with neighbours and increased efforts to use the opportunities of cross border electricity trade experience with the implementation of the internal market has shown that uncoordinated national action can lead to severe problems for the market in particular in closely interconnected areas where the decisions of member states often have tangible impact on their neighbours to achieve the positive effects of the internal electricity market for consumer welfare the security of supply and decarbonisation member states in particular their independent regulatory authorities are required to cooperate on regulatory measures which have cross border effects fragmented national state interventions in energy markets constitute an increasing risk to the proper functioning of cross border electricity markets acer should therefore be given role in the development of coordinated european resource adequacy assessment in close cooperation with the european network of transmission system operators for electricity in order to avoid the problems of fragmented national assessments which follow different uncoordinated methods and do not sufficiently take into account the situation in neighbouring countries acer should also supervise the technical parameters developed by the entso for electricity for the efficient participation of cross border capacities and other technical features of capacity mechanisms despite significant progress in integrating and interconnecting the internal electricity market some member states or regions remain isolated or not sufficiently interconnected in particular insular member states and member states located on the periphery of the union in its work acer should take account of the specific situation of those member states or regions as appropriate the security of the electricity supply requires coordinated approach to preparing for unexpected supply crises acer should therefore coordinate national actions related to risk preparedness in accordance with regulation of the european parliament and of the council because of the close interconnection of the union electricity grid and the increasing need to cooperate with neighbouring countries to maintain grid stability and integrate large volumes of renewable energy regional coordination centres will play an important role for the coordination of transmission system operators acer should guarantee regulatory oversight of the regional coordination centres where necessary as large parts of new electricity generation capacity will be connected at local level distribution system operators are to play an important role when it comes to operating the union electricity system in flexible and efficient manner member states should cooperate closely eliminating obstacles to cross border exchanges of electricity and natural gas with view to achieving the objectives of the union energy policy acer was established to fill the regulatory gap at union level and to contribute towards the effective functioning of the internal markets for electricity and natural gas acer enables regulatory authorities to enhance their cooperation at union level and participate on mutual basis in the exercise of union related functions acer should ensure that regulatory functions performed by the regulatory authorities in accordance with directive of the european parliament and of the council and directive ec of the european parliament and of the council are properly coordinated and where necessary completed at union level to that end it is necessary to guarantee the independence of acer from electricity and gas producers transmission system operators and distribution system operators whether public or private and consumers and to ensure the conformity of its actions with union law its technical and regulatory capacities and its transparency amenability to democratic control including accountability to the european parliament and efficiency acer should monitor regional cooperation between transmission system operators in the electricity and gas sectors as well as the execution of the tasks of the entso for electricity and the european network of transmission system operators for gas acer should also monitor the implementation of the tasks of other entities with regulated functions of union wide dimension such as energy exchanges acer involvement is essential in order to ensure that the cooperation between transmission system operators and the operation of other entities with union wide functions proceed in an efficient and transparent way for the benefit of the internal markets for electricity and natural gas the regulatory authorities should coordinate among themselves when carrying out their tasks to ensure that the entso for electricity the european entity for distribution system operators and the regional coordination centres comply with their obligations under the regulatory framework of the internal energy market and with acer decisions with the expansion of the operational responsibilities of the entso for electricity the eu dso entity and the regional coordination centres it is necessary to enhance the oversight of such entities operating at regional or union wide level the procedure established in this regulation ensures that acer supports the regulatory authorities when performing those functions as referred to in directive in order to ensure that acer has the information it needs to carry out its tasks acer should be able to request and to receive that information from the regulatory authorities the entso for electricity the entso for gas the regional coordination centres the eu dso entity the transmission system operators and the nominated electricity market operators acer should monitor in cooperation with the commission the member states and relevant national authorities the internal markets for electricity and natural gas and inform the european parliament the commission and the national authorities of its findings where appropriate acer monitoring tasks should not duplicate or hamper monitoring by the commission or by national authorities in particular national competition authorities acer provides an integrated framework which enables the regulatory authorities to participate and cooperate that framework facilitates the uniform application of the legislation on the internal markets for electricity and natural gas throughout the union as regards situations concerning more than one member state acer has been granted the power to adopt individual decisions that power should under clearly specified conditions cover technical and regulatory issues which require regional coordination in particular those concerning the implementation of network codes and guidelines cooperation within regional coordination centres the regulatory decisions necessary to effectively monitor wholesale energy market integrity and transparency decisions concerning electricity and natural gas infrastructure that connects or that might connect at least two member states and as last resort exemptions from the internal market rules for new electricity interconnectors and new gas infrastructure located in more than one member state revision of the network codes and guidelines covers amendments which are necessary to take into account the evolution of the market without substantially changing those network codes and guidelines or creating new competences of acer acer has an important role in developing framework guidelines which are non binding by nature network codes should be in line with those framework guidelines it is also considered to be appropriate for acer and consistent with its purpose to have role in reviewing and amending draft network codes to ensure that they are in line with the framework guidelines and provide for the necessary degree of harmonisation before it submits them to the commission for adoption with the adoption of set of network codes and guidelines which provide for the stepwise implementation and further refinement of common regional and union wide rules acer role with regard to monitoring and contributing to the implementation of the network codes and guidelines has increased the effective monitoring of network codes and guidelines is key function of acer and is crucial to the implementation of internal market rules during the implementation of network codes and guidelines it has emerged that it would be useful to streamline the procedures for the regulatory approval of regional or union wide terms and conditions or methodologies that are developed under the network codes and guidelines by submitting them directly to acer to allow regulatory authorities represented in the board of regulators to decide on such terms and conditions or methodologies since the stepwise harmonisation of the union energy markets regularly involves finding regional solutions as an interim step and many terms and conditions and methodologies need to be approved by limited number of regulatory authorities for specific region it is appropriate to reflect the regional dimension of the internal market in this regulation and to provide for appropriate governance mechanisms decisions on proposals for joint regional terms and conditions or methodologies should therefore be taken by the competent regulatory authorities of the region concerned unless those decisions have tangible impact on the internal energy market since acer has an overview of the regulatory authorities it should have an advisory role with respect to the commission other union institutions and regulatory authorities as regards the issues relating to the purpose for which it was established it should also be required to inform the commission where it finds that the cooperation between transmission system operators does not produce the necessary results or that regulatory authority whose decision infringes the network codes and guidelines has not implemented an opinion recommendation or decision of acer appropriately acer should also be able to make recommendations to assist regulatory authorities and market participants in sharing good practices the entso for electricity the entso for gas the eu dso entity transmission system operators the regional coordination centres and the nominated electricity market operators should give the utmost consideration to the opinions and recommendations of acer that are addressed to them pursuant to this regulation acer should consult interested parties where appropriate and provide them with reasonable opportunity to comment on proposed measures such as network codes and rules acer should contribute to the implementation of the guidelines on trans european energy networks as laid down in regulation no in particular when providing its opinion on the non binding union wide year network development plans acer should contribute to the efforts of enhancing energy security acer activities should be consistent with the objectives and targets of the energy union which has five closely related and mutually reinforcing dimensions including decarbonisation as outlined in article of regulation of the european parliament and of the council in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity acer should adopt individual decisions only in clearly defined circumstances on issues that are strictly related to the purposes for which acer was established in order to ensure that acer framework is efficient and coherent with other decentralised agencies the rules governing acer should be aligned with the common approach agreed between the european parliament the council of the eu and the european commission on decentralised agencies however to the extent necessary acer structure should be adapted to meet the specific needs of energy regulation in particular the specific role of the regulatory authorities needs to be taken fully into account and their independence guaranteed additional changes to this regulation may be envisaged in the future in order to bring the regulation fully in line with the common approach based on the current needs of energy regulation deviations from the common approach are necessary the commission should carry out an evaluation to assess acer performance in relation to acer objectives mandate and tasks and following that evaluation the commission should be able to propose amendments to this regulation the administrative board should have the necessary powers to establish the budget check its implementation draw up internal rules adopt financial regulations and appoint director rotation system should be used for the renewal of the members of the administrative board who are appointed by the council so as to ensure balanced participation of member states over time the administrative board should act independently and objectively in the public interest and should not seek or follow political instructions acer should have the necessary powers to perform its regulatory functions in an efficient transparent reasoned and above all independent manner acer independence from electricity and gas producers and from transmission system operators and distribution system operators as well as other private and corporate interests is not only key principle of
